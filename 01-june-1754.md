## June 1754

June 26. Wednesday. Took my departure from York Fort,[^june-1754-1] and paddled up Hays River to Amista-Asinee[^june-1754-2] or Great Stone, distant from the Fort 24 miles; our course about S.W.b.W.; here we put up for the night.

[^june-1754-1]: York Factory, or Fort Nelson, may be said to date back to the year 1671, when Governor Bayly of the Hudson's Bay Company, with Pierre Esprit Radisson, first opened trade with the natives at the mouth of the Nelson. Presumably some sort of rude post was built at that time, or soon thereafter. In 1682, Radisson - now acting in the French interest - built Fort Bourbon near the mouth of Hayes river. Thereafter the post repeatedly changed hands. The accompanying plate - reduced from one in Robson's "Hudson's Bay" - shows the capture of the fort by D'Iberville in 1694. Restored under the terms of the treaty of Utrecht, in 1782 it was again captured by the French, under La Perouse. For further particulars, see Kingstord's "History of Canada," iii, ch. 1 and 2; Radisson's "Voyages," Prince Society, 1885; Oldmixon's "British Empire in America"; Robson's "Hudson's Bay"; Jérémie’s Narrative, in "Recuetl des voyages du Nord," iii; Bacqueville de la Potherie's "Histoire de l'Amérique Septentrionale." See also the very interesting Account of the Forts in the Bay in 1771, by Andrew Granam, quoted by Dr. George Bryce in his "Hudson's Bay Company,: ch. xiii.

[^june-1754-2]: A small tributary of Hayes river, flowing in on the north side, and still known to the Indians as the Amista-Asinee. The English name is now given as Stoney river or creek. The bed is full of large, round boulders; hence the name. Lake Mistassini represents another form of the same name.

June 27. Thursday. Paddled up Hays River till we came to Apet-Sepee, or Fire-Steel River,[^june-1754-3] and paddled up to Mistick-Apethaw Sepee,[^june-1754-4] or, Wood Partridge River, and there put up for the night.

[^june-1754-3]: Steel river, on Arrowsmith’s and other early maps. Now regarded as a portion of the Hayes.

[^june-1754-4]: Shamattawa river. Mr. Owen O'Sullvan, of the Geological Survey, says that a branch of the Shamattawa, still bears the name of Mistiek-Apethaw. The Shamattawa rises in Island lake, about 53° 40' N., and between 94° and 95° W. In Mathew Cocking's Journal of 1772-73 he mentions a river, the Chuckitanaw, which is evidently Hendry's Mistick-Apethaw. "It empties," says Cocking, “into Steel River forty miles southwest from its entrance. From York Fort to the mouth of the Chuckitanaw River canoes may be navigated pretty easy; above this river the water becomes shoal."

June 28. Friday. Paddled up Apet-Sepee to Pine Reach,[^june-1754-5] and put up for the night.

[^june-1754-5]: A local name that has not survived. Pine grows all along this portion of the Hayes. In a foot-note to the original Journal, Andrew Graham say, "From, York Fort to Pine Reach sixty measured miles," which fixes the position of Pine Reach with at least approximate accuracy. Graham was a writer at York Factory at the time of Hendry's journey, and afterward became factor at the same place.

June 29. Saturday. Took my departure from Pine Reach, and paddled up Apet-Sepee 25 miles N.W.: passed four large falls; the river about 16 poles wide, the banks high, and tall woods.

June 30. Sunday. Took my departure from inclosed falls[^june-1754-6] and paddled 28 miles N.W.b.N. & N.W.; the lands and woods as yesterday; passed seventeen places where the water was so shoal as to be under the necessity to carry our goads-and canoes over.

[^june-1754-6]: Probably The Rock, a well-known point on the Hayes route. In Archibald MeDonald’s Journal of a Canoe Voyage from Hudson's Bay to the Pacific, 1828, with Sir George Simpson, they left York Factory on July 12, and arrived at The Rock on the 14th. This was about half the time taken by Hendry, but each of Sir George Simpson's "light canoes" was manned by nine picked men, and he had the reputation throughout theWest of travelling at a furious pace. In 1828 the Hudson's Bay Company had a small trading post at The Rock. McDonald says, "Had a peep at the Rock, an old establishment with its gardens." Malcolm McLeod, in a note to McDonald's Journal, says of The Rock, "There are a number of portages in pretty close succession a little above this, if I remember aright, and at one of them the boats also have to be hauled over. There is a regular roadway for the purpose, with round sticks a few feet apart for rolling the boats on. A couple of crews can haul over one of them in a trice."
