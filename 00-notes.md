# Editor's notes 1908

In its evidence before the parliamentary committee of 1749 the Hudson's Bay Company was compelled to fall back upon the vague wanderings of Henry Kellsey, in the previous century, to bolster up its contention that it had been true to the implied obligation of its charter; that is to say, that it had promoted the exploration of the vast territory granted by King Charles the Second. It was part of the irony of circumstances that only five years after the publication of the committee's report a really effective argument was furnished, on behalf of the company, by the expedition of Anthony Hendry.

An impartial analysis of Kellsey's journal leaves the impression that the company's case would have been very little weakened by its omission. It has been claimed for Kellsey that on this journey of 1691 or 1692 he reached the Saskatchewan country. Dr. Elliott Coues even went so far as to say that Kellsey was on Lake Winnipeg in July and August, 1692. The statement was made at second hand. If Dr. Coues had kept to his usual careful practice of relying only upon the original documents, he would have found that there is nothing whatever in Kellsey's journal to support such a contention. Neither is there any satisfactory proof that he reached the Saskatchewan, or was at any time within the valley of the Saskatchewan. His distances and directions and his descriptions of the country traversed, so far as they suggest anything, rather go to show that his route lay toward South Indian lake or Granville lake, on the waters of the Churchill. The whole narrative, however, especially in the light of surrounding circumstances, is too unsubstantial to afford any safe ground for historical conclusions.

The case of Anthony Hendry is entirely different. It is possible to follow him almost step by step from the time he left York Factory, in June, 1754, until he returned to it in June of the following year. During that period of nearly twelve months this plucky young fur-trader travelled, with no white companion, a thousand miles inland, from York Factory to the upper waters of the South Saskatchewan, wintering in the country of the fierce Blackfeet, and returning in safety to the shores of the bay. In the course of his journey he traversed an immense extent of unexplored country. It may be a moot point whether or not Hendry was the actual discoverer of the South Saskatchewan. Certainly his is the first unquestionably authentic description of the river, as well as of the great plain lying between the North and South Saskatchewan.

After leaving York Factory, Hendry's course lay up the Hayes river to what was then called Attick-Sagohan or Deer Lake, now known as Knee lake. Even this far there is no record of any earlier exploration, though it is quite possible that some of the men of the Hudson's Bay Company may have reached Knee or Oxford lakes on trading expeditions. There is a note, however, on the margin of Hendry's journal, by Andrew Graham, afterward factor at York, in which the significant statement is made that Hendry was "the first person who ventured inland." This lends at least some colour to the argument, advanced by opponents of the company, that the whole story of Kellsey's journey was a fabrication.

From Knee lake it becomes for a time a little more difficult to follow Hendry's movements. The natural supposition would be that he followed the afterwards familiar route by way of Oxford lake, Echimamish river and the Playgreen lakes to Lake Winnipeg; and this supposition gains support from the fact that he presently mentions a lake which he calls Christianaux - one of the old French names for Lake Winnipeg.[^notes-1] His distances, however, put such a theory out of court; and even if that were not the case, his description of Christianaux lake cannot be made to fit Winnipeg. He makes the explicit statement that in crossing the lake he "passed 22 woody islands." As everyone knows, the northern end of Lake Winnipeg is singularly free of islands. On the other hand, it took him two days to cross Christianaux lake, and he makes the distance fifty-one miles. Admitting that his distances may have been somewhat exaggerated, (and as will be seen presently the probabilities point the other way), there is no lake of this size - on the maps - anywhere between York Factory and Lake Winnipeg. It happens, however, that between Knee and Oxford lakes and Cross lake on the Nelson lies a considerable extent of country that his never been explored; or rather it was supposed that it had never been explored. One or two small lakes appear on the maps, but they are purely conjectural. Both the Nelson river and the Hayes route have been carefully surveyed in recent years, but no officer of the Geological Survey has ever yet traversed the country between Oxford lake and the Nelson. So far as was known, up to a short time ago, no direct canoe route existed from Oxford lake to the Nelson. In the summer of 1906, however, Mr. Owen O'Sullivan of the Survey met at Oxford House the Rev. Mr. Banel, a missionary, who had just come by canoe from his headquarters on Cross lake to Oxford, and had discovered about midway an unmapped lake, so large that he had been lost upon it for three days. The lake was described as being about a day's journey from Oxford lake. There does not seem to be any reasonable doubt that the lake discovered by Father Banel is the same traversed by Hendry in 1754, and named by him Christianaux.

[^notes-1]: Hendry may have got the name from DeLisle's Carte du Canada, 1703, or one of the other maps of the period on which Christianaux, or Christinaux, applies to a suppositious lake, north of Lake Nipigon, and connected with Lac des Assenipoules - one of the several names applied to Lake Winnipeg.

In tracing Hendry's route throughout all this early part of his journey much help is derived from a comparison of his journal with that of another officer of the Hudson's Bay Company, Mathew Cocking, who journeyed inland from York Factory in 1772. Cocking's Deer lake is, beyond reasonable question, Hendry's Attick-Sagohai - present Knee lake; and the latter's Christianaux lake becomes Pimochickomow in Cocking's narrative. Cocking notes the fact that there are "many islands in the lake," and gives his distance through the lake as sixty-five miles, from which it would appear that Hendry underestimated rather than exaggerated the length of the lake.

Leaving Christianaux lake, Hendry apparently took the same river to Cross lake followed by Father Banel. For some reason he makes no special mention of Cross lake, but says that he "took his departure from Shad fall" and paddled up a river. This river is given in Cocking's journal as the Minahage or Pine river - the Minago of our modern maps. Ascending this stream he came to a large lake, which he calls Othenume, and Cocking, Oteatowan Sockoegan; evidently Moose lake. Both Hendry's and Cocking's descriptions agree with recent accounts of Moose lake. Paddling up a river emptying into Moose lake, Hendry finally reached the Saskatchewan, or Keiskatchewan as he spells it, and the following day came to a French house, Fort "Basquea," at the mouth of the Pasquia river.

This place, now known as The Pas, was a notable spot throughout the entire period of the fur-trade, from the days of La Vérendrye down. The elder La Vérendrye, so far as his journals and letters show, was never on the Saskatchewan, but one of his sons built Fort Bourbon on the shores of Cedar lake, about 1748, and ascended the river as far as the forks, somewhere below which he built Fort Poskoyac. After the death of the elder La Vérendrye, in 1749, Jacques Legardeur de Seint-Pierre was sent out to continue his explorations in the far west. A party of his men are said to have ascended one of the branches of the Saskatchewan to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, in 1751, and built there Fort La Jonquière. This will be referred to again. Two years later Saint-Luc de La Corne, who had been sent to replace Saint-Pierre, is said to have built Fort Poskoyac - fort Poskoyac the second - on the lower Saskatchewan. In a paper read before the Society (R.S.C., 1906, pt. I), Judge Prud'homme furnishes a very ingenious identification of the various French forts built, or said to have been built, on the Saskatchewan. He enumerates six: Forts Bourbon and Poskoyac, built by the La Vérendrye; Fort La Jonquière, built by de Niverville's men; and Forts La Corne, Poskoyac and Pasquia (Poste Pasquia), by Saint-Luc de La Corne. Of these, he says that Fort Bourbon was situated upon Cedar lake, and La Jonquière on the upper Saskatchewan. The two Forts Poskoyac were on the lower Saskatchewan; La Vérendrye's Poskoyac, near the Forks of the Saskatchewan; La Corne's fort of the same name at the entrance to Cumberland Lake; Fort La Corne some distance below the Forks; and Poste Pasquia on the Carrot river.

The late Dr. Elliott Coues, in one of his foot-notes to the Henry Thompson Journals ("New Light on the Early History of the Greater Northwest," II, 469), says that The Pas, close to the mouth of the Pasquia River, was the location of old Fort Poskoyac or Poscoiac. We have the evidence of both Hendry's Journal and the Journal of Cocking to prove that a French fort existed at or near the mouth of the Pasquia River. The former establishes the presence of a second French fort between the mouth of the Pasquia and the Forks of the Saskatchewan - in fact not very many miles below the Forks. Hendry gives no name to this upper fort, but mentions that it was "subordinate to Basquia." Cocking, paddling up the Saskatchewan in 1772, left Basquia on August 1st, and ten days later reached a point on the river where the families of his Indian guides were awaiting them. "Formerly," he notes in his Journal, "the French had a House here... From Basquia to this place I make the course to be S. 58° W. and distance 150 miles." Three days before, that is on the 8th of the month, he had passed "an old Trading House belonging to the French, pedlars before the conquest of Quebec," This was about 92 miles from Basquia, and 58 miles from the upper fort. Cocking, therefore, gives us three French posts between The Pas and the Forks. Hendry for some reason does not mention the middle post. Possibly he passed the spot after dark; or may have been hugging the other bank of the river and so missed it; or, again, it may have been built after his visit.

Of these three forts, we know that the lower was situated at the mouth of the Pasquia. There is less certainty as to the position of the other two. Judge Prud'homme says of the upper one: "Fort La Corne, appelé Nipawi par les sauvages, fondé par le chevalier Saint-Luc de la Corne, a quelques milles a l'est de la jonction des branches sud et nord de la Saskatchewan, en 1753." He is somewhat indefinite as to the position. Sir Alexander Mackenzie says that the French had an establishment at Nipawi long before and at the conquest of Canada in the Journal of Alexander Henry, the Younger, it is stated (p. 482) that he "camped at the spot where the French formerly had an establishment called Fort Saint-Louis, built by Saint-Luc de la Corne in a low bottom on the S. side, where some years ago were still to be seen remains of agricultural implements and carriage-wheels. Their road to the plains is still to be seen, winding up a valley on the S. side." In foot-notes to the Henry Thompson Journals (pp. 481-3), Dr. Coues clearly identifies the position of this old French fort - La Corne, a la Corne, de la Corne, St. Louis, Nipawi, Nippeween, as it was variously called - as "within the present Indian reserve, close to or at the mouth of Payoeran cr., and thus about 12 m. in an air line below the forks - much more by the bends of the river. The position is about the center of Tp. 48, R. xx, W. of the 2d init. merid."

From Cocking's description of the river above Pasquia it is reasonably certain that the point he reached on August 11th, and where he says the French formerly had a House, was the site of Fort La Corne, although his distances are in that event far astray. He makes the distance from Pasquia to this point 150 miles. John Fleming, who surveyed the river from Fort La Corne to The Pas in 1858 (Hind's "Narrative of the Canadian Red River Expedition," etc., I, ch. XXI.), makes the distance about 213 miles.

As to the third French post, between Fort Le Corne and Fort Poskoyac, this would seem to be Judge Prud'homme's Fort Poskoyac (the second), "appelé aussi Francais, fondé à l'entrée du lac Cumberland par M. de la Corne, entre 1753 et 1755"; but if so, it could not have been situated at the entrance to Cumberland Lake. Fleming makes the distance from The Pas to Cumberland Lake 63 miles. Cocking mentions a carrying-place, on the north side of the river, into a lake named Menistaquatakow, which he makes 52 miles from Pasquia. As he apparently took a short cut across Saskeram Lake, and thus avoided the deep bend in the river north of that lake, his distances would about agree with those of Fleming, and his Menistaquatakow would be Cumberland Lake. But the "old Trading House belonging to the French pedlars," which he passed on August 8th, was about 58 miles above Menistaquatakow Lake. In the interval he had passed a small branch on the south side of the Saskatchewan which "joins the river a little above Basquia"  - clearly Sipanok Canal, which runs almost due east to Carrot River, the latter joining the Saskatchewan a little above the Pasquia. From Sipanok Canal to the old fort Cocking's distance is about 27 miles. A few miles below the fort he passed the mouth of a branch bearing S. by E., which he calls Peatagow River. On Fleming's map (Hind's "Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition, 1858"), a small stream is shown entering the Saskatchewan from the south-east, about 103° 55'. As the middle post was about ten miles above Peatagow River, we will be reasonably safe in placing it in long. 104°. Whether or not this was the fort which Judge Prud'homme calls Fort Poskoyac le second, built by La Corne between 1753 and 1755, it is impossible to say. It certainly is nowhere near the site fixed by Judge Prud'homme.

We have, then, the evidence of both Hendry and Cocking as to the existence of two French posts on the Saskatchewan, between the Forks and The Pas; and Cocking bears witness to the presence of a third. With the exception of Fort La Corne, however, it is impossible to reconcile Judge Prud'homme's descriptions with the evidence of these early explorers. Hendry visited the French post at the mouth of the Pasquia in 1754-55, and says of it, "This House has been long a place of Trade belonging to the French." Judge Prud'homme dates the three posts below the Forks between 1753 and 1755; that is to say, just about the time of Hendry's visit.

To sum up, the evidence afforded by these two journals goes to show that there were three French posts on the Saskatchewan between The Pas and the Forks. Of these the oldest was that at The Pas, or the mouth of the Pasquia, built by the Chevalier de La Vérendrye about 1748. The other two, built by Saint-Luc de La Corne, were minor posts; the first situated about 104°; and the upper post - Fort La Corne - about 104° 32'. Fort La Corne was built in 1753; the lower fort may have been built after Hendry descended the river in 1755.

As Hendry is the only British explorer or trader known to have visited Fort Poskoyac, or indeed any of the French forts west of Lake Superior, up to the close of the period of French rule in Canada, his description of the fort, with the account of his meeting with the French traders, is of exceptional value.

In this connection the following, from Robson's "Account of Six years residence in Hudson's-Bay" (pp. 62-63), is of interest: "It is universally believed among the servants, that the French travel many hundred miles over land from Canada to the heads of our rivers in the Bay, and that they have erected huts and settled a considerable factory upon a lake at the head of Nelson-river; trading with the natives for the lightest and most valuable furs, which they carry a long way before they find a conveyance by water; and this general opinion is not taken up at random, but supported by particular incontestable evidences of the fact. I have seen French guns among the natives that come to York-fort; and once heard Mr. Brady, the surgeon, converse with one of them in the French language. I have also frequently seen in the governor's hand, a letter addressed to him from the chief factor at the French settlement on Nelson-river. It was written in French and Indian; and the purport of it was to establish trade between them and the English at York-fort, for those heavy goods which the French stood in great need of, but could not bring from Canada, such as guns, kettles, tobacco, &c., and the English were desired to say, how much beaver they expected in exchange for these articles. The governor told us, that he had sent a copy of the letter to England; and added, that if the Company consented to such a treaty, we should get no furs but what came through the hands of the French, who would soon have huts all the way down Nelson-river."

"The linguists informed me, that they have had a description of the French factory at the head of Nelson-river from different Indians, who all agreed in the principal circumstances, and remarkably in this, that the French have a large boat or sloop upon the lake. These people formerly would have been glad to have had the English accompany them up the rivers; and were once very solicitous to engage us to go up, that we might head them against the French Indians; but they are now very easy and silent upon that subject; the French by kind offices and a liberality in dealing, which we think of no consequence, have obtained so much influence over almost all the natives, that many of them are actually turned factors for the French at our settlements for heavy goods. This the Indians openly acknowledged to the linguist in the year 1746, just before I left York-fort."

After Hendry's day the ruins of the old fort are constantly referred to by explorers and traders who passed them on their way up the Saskatchewan. When Cocking went up in 1772 he mentions Basquia as a "long frequented place where the Canadians rendezvous and trade with the natives." Three years later, Alexander Henry, the elder, with Joseph and Thomas Frobisher and the notorious Peter Pond, landed at a Cree encampment on the Pasquia a little above its mouth, and therefore not far from the site of Fort Poskoyac. The traders were politely entertained by a crafty old Indian river-baron named Chatique, who laid tribute upon all that they had, comforting them with the assurance that if they did not pay up cheerfully he would take their lives as well as their possessions. Alexander Henry's nephew and namesake passed the mouth of the Pasquia, or "the little river of Montagne du Pas," as he calls it, in 1808, and mentions that some traces of the old French establishment were even then visible.

Hendry has reached the Saskatchewan, and before speaking of his further explorations, it may be in place to point out that he was the first British trader upon the waters of that great highway of the west. There has been a widespread impression, based upon Alexander Mackenzie's statements in his History of the Fur Trade, that the first British traders who reached the Saskatchewan came from Montreal. "In 1770," says Dr. Coues, "Thomas Curry, of Montreal, journeyed to Fort Bourbon, with guides, interpreters, and four canoes and wintered 1770-71. This pioneer of all the English traders was satisfied with his venture, and never repeated it; but he was immediately succeeded by James Finlay, who in 1771 went as far as Nipawi, then the last French settlement on the Saskatchewan." Curry and Finlay may be regarded as the scouts of that great fur trading enterprise that afterward became known as the North West Company. The men of the North West Company are entitled to the credit of widespread explorations in the west, but the honour of first reaching the Saskatchewan undoubtedly belongs to a Hudson's Bay man, Anthony Hendry.

There seems, too, to have been some misunderstanding as to the relative claims of Curry and Finlay, for we learn from Cocking that Finlay was on the Saskatchewan at least as early as 1767. In paddling up the river, from Pasquia to the Forks, Cocking passed the ruins of a trading post in which, he says, "One Mr. Finlay, of Montreal, resided five years ago." Cocking passed the place in August, 1772. Under date of July 23rd of the same year he notes in his journal, "The Pedlar, Mr. Currie (who intercepted great part of York Fort trade this year) is one day's paddling below this river, at Cedar Lake"; and Andrew Graham, the Factor, adds in a footnote: "Mr. Currie's encroachments was the reason I sent Mr. Cocking inland." This confirms Dr. Coues' statement that Curry, or Currie, was somewhere on the lower waters of the Saskatchewan in 1771, but it is evident that he did not return that year, as he was at Cedar Lake in August, 1772; and five years earlier Finlay was not merely on the Saskatchewan, but had built a trading post well up toward the Forks.

To return to Anthony Hendry and his journal. After he left Fort Poskoyac his course lay for a few miles up the Saskatchewan; six miles, according to his journal. Then he left the river and paddled sixteen miles across a lake on the south side. This could only be Saskeram lake. Then, he says, he came to Peatago river, which he ascended for fifty-five miles, until he could get no farther, and decided to abandon his canoe and travel overland. One would naturally suppose that his river must be the small stream that enters the western end of Saskeram lake, but the distance travelled puts this out of the question. The maps show no other river emptying directly into Saskeram lakes but I am informed by Mr. D. B. Dowling, of the Geological Survey, to whom I am indebted for a great deal of assistance in tracing Hendry's course after he left the main Saskatchewan, that in periods of high water a channel might easily be found from Saskeram lake to Carrot river. In any event, a short portage would take Hendry to this important tributary of the Saskatchewan, and it can safely be assumed that his Peatago river was the Carrot.

July 27th, Hendry abandoned his canoes, and travelled overland in a general southwesterly direction. He crossed the South Saskatchewan somewhere about Clark Crossing, north of Saskatoon, and three days later reached the North Saskatchewan. He calls the former Wapesewcopet, and the latter Sechonby. As far as one can judge he reached the North Saskatchewan at the Elbow, where the Canadian Northern crosses the river, about midway between Prince Albert and Battleford. He did not cross the river, but continued his way westward, following its banks, to a point somewhere in the neighbourhood of the site of Battleford.

From here he turned to the south-west until he came to a small river which he calls Chacutenah, presumably Sounding Creek. Nearly a month later, after an uneventful journey over the Great Plain, he crossed the Waskesew. It is pretty safe to assume that this was the Red Deer, and that the place where Hendry crossed was a little above Knee Hills Creek. This conclusion is based upon careful comparison of his distances and directions and his description of the country, all three pointing to the place indicated. Curiously enough, Waskesew means Red Deer, but this in itself has no particular significance, as there have been innumerable Deer rivers throughout the west.

Anyone who has made a study of early western place-names knows how useless they are, generally speaking, as a guide to the route of explorers. Sometimes, as in the case of Samuel Hearne, those who attempt to trace the course of explorers on a modern map are led absolutely astray by the application of a familiar name to an entirely different body of water. One experiences the same difficulty, to an acute degree, in the case of Hendry. An attempt to identify some of his place-names with rivers and lakes known at one time or another under the same name, and to reconcile these with his distances and directions as worked out on a modern map, resulted in a state of such hopeless confusion that the only safe plan seemed to be to ignore place-names altogether, so far as the identification of his route was concerned. For instance, he mentions a Nelson river, and one is only saved from the mistake of confounding it with the present Nelson by the fact that the very next day he reached the Saskatchewan. When he comes to the Waskesew the case is even worse. In a foot-note Andrew Graham informs us that "Keskatchew and Waskesew River is all one river, and is called by the French Christianaux River, from the lake of that name." Undoubtedly the Red Deer and the Saskatchewan are all one river, but Hendry has already crossed the South Saskatchewan and seen the North Saskatchewan. Why did he not name them Keskatchew or Waskesew? Again, here is the old French name Christianaux applied to the Saskatchewan, and to Lake Winnipeg. Hendry crossed a lake which he names Christianaux, and which by no possible manipulation of his distances can be made to fit Lake Winnipeg. It is morally certain that he never saw Lake Winnipeg on either his outward or return journey. One is reduced to the conclusion that either he or Graham confused the large lake which he crossed, and which he named Christianaux, with Lake Winnipeg.

Three days after crossing the Red Deer, Hendry arrived at a large camp of Archithinue Indians. The name occurs repeatedly in his narrative, and one of the chief objects of his journey seems to have been to get in touch with this tribe and induce them to bring furs down to York Factory. It would be impossible to identify the tribe with any degree of certainty were it not that Cocking supplies the key. He, too, visited the Archithinues, and in his Journal under date of December 1st, 1772, he says, "This tribe is named Powestic-Athinuewuck (i.e.) Water-fall Indians. There are four tribes or Nations more, which are all Equestrian Indians; viz.: Mithco-Athinuwuck or Bloody Indians, Koskitow-Wathesitock or Blackfooted Indians, Pegonow or Muddy-water Indians, and Sassewuck or Woody Country Indians."[^notes-2] The Archithinue Indians whom Hendry visited, and of whom he gives an exceedingly interesting account, were, therefore, Blackfeet. The fact that, although he went among them with no white companion, he was well received, hospitably entertained, and permitted to spend the winter in the Blackfeet country without molestation, is well worth noting in view of the fact that the later history of the tribe is one long story of fierce hostility to the white men. One is tempted to believe that the white man must himself have been largely responsible for such a change of front on the part of the Blackfeet.

[^notes-2]: See also Franklin's "Polar Sea." I, 169, as to the divisions and names of the Blackfeet confederacy.

Hendry's description of the manners and customs of this tribe, as he found them in 1754, may very well be supplemented by the following particulars taken from Cocking's journal. "In all their actions," he says, "they far excell the other Natives. They are all well mounted on light, sprightly Animals; their Weopons, Bows and Arrows. Several have on Jackets of Moose leather six fold, quilted, and without sleeves. They likewise use pack-horses, which gives their Women a great advantage over the other Women who are either carrying or hauling of sledges every day in the year. They appear to me more like Europeans than Americans [meaning Indians]."

"Our Archithinue friends are very Hospitable, continually inviting us to partake of their best fare; generally berries infused in water with fat, very agreeable eating. Their manner of showing respect to strangers is, in holding the pipe while they smoke. This is done three times. Afterwards every person smokes in common, the Women excepted, whom I did not observe to take the Pipe. The tobacco they use is of their own planting, which hath a disagreeable flavour; I have preserved a specimen. These people are much more cleanly in their cloathing and food than my companions [Crees]. Their victuals are dressed in earthern pots, of their own manufacturing; much in the same form as Newcastle pots, but without feet; their fire tackling a black stone used as flint, and a kind of ore as a steel, using tuss balls as tinder, (i.e.) a kind of moss."

"The Slaves whom they have preserved alive are used with kindness. They are young people of both sexes, and are adopted into the families of those who have lost their children either by war or sickness. They torture all the aged of both sexes in a most shocking and deliberate manner."

The information as to the Blackfeet and their manner of living, at the time white men first went among them, as contained in the journals of Hendry and Cocking, may be taken to correct the inaccurate statements of later writers, based upon insufficient evidence. For instance, George Bird Grinnell, in his "Blackfoot Lodge Tales," says that "in ancient times it [fire] was obtained by means of fire sticks.... The starting of the spark with these sticks is said to have been hard work. At almost their first meeting with the whites they obtained flints and steels, and leaned how to use them." It is clear from Cocking's narrative that the Blackfeet had something much more effective than fire-sticks in 1772, and that they did not have to thank white men for a knowledge of the principle of the flint and steel.

Again, Grinnell says: "It is doubtful if the Blackfeet ever made any pottery or basket ware." Cocking distinctly says that they did make earthern pots; and Hendry was served with boiled buffalo meat in wicker baskets. Again, Grinnell says that the Blackfeet obtained horses in the earliest years of the nineteenth century. Hendry describes them as accomplished horsemen half a century before, and from his account it is clear that the Blackfeet had possessed horses for many years previously. Probably the earliest years of the eighteenth century would be nearer the mark, as the date when the Blackfeet first made use of the horse.

After taking leave of the hospitable Blackfeet, Hendry travelled in a leisurely fashion, first to the westward, crossing Knee Hills Creek; then north-west to a point near the present line of the Calgary and Edmonton railway, about 51° 50' N. This was his farthest point to the westward. Turning east, he crossed Three Hills Creek; turned north-east and crossed Devils Pine Creek; returned to and re-crossed Three Hills Creek; then north-east again to a long, narrow lake which he calls Archithinue Lake, and which appears to have been present Devils Pine Lake. It was now the end of February, 1755, and a few days later Hendry, having travelled north-east from Devils Pine Lake, reached the Red Deer once more, many miles above the point where he had crossed five months before. He journeyed down-stream on the ice for a few miles, and then he and his Indians set to work to build canoes and gather provisions for the long trip back to Hudson Bay. April 23rd, the river began to break up, and five days later Hendry embarked and paddled rapidly down-stream. He followed the Red Deer to its junction with the South Saskatchewan, and the latter to the Forks. Below the Forks he visited a French trading post, an outpost of the main establishment at the mouth of the Pasquia. At the latter he was entertained by the officer in charge of the district, who had been absent on his outward journey. This officer was no doubt La Corne. From Fort Poskoyac, Hendry seems to have followed substantially the same route as on his outward trip, and reached York Fort on June 20th, 1755, after an absence of almost twelve months.

In the course of this eventful and very important journey, Hendry explored an immense extent of new country. It is a debatable point whether he was the actual discoverer of the South Saskatchewan and North Saskatchewan. Certainly his is the only description we have of any portion of either branch, up to the year 1754. As already mentioned, a party of Saint-Pierre's men are said to have ascended one of the branches to its upper waters, and built Fort La Jonquière there, in 1751; that is, three years before Hendry's journey. Here is Saint-Pierre's own account of the matter, in his Journal: "The order which I gave to the Chevalier de Niverville, to establish a post three hundred leagues above that of Paskoya, was executed on the 20th May, 1751. He sent off ten men in two canoes, who ascended the river Paskoya as far as the Rocky Mountains, where they made a good fort, which I named Fort Lajonquière, and a considerable store of provisions, in expectation of the arrival of M. de Niverville, who was to set out a month after them, but was prevented by a serious illness." It would appear that de Niverville eventually reached Fort Lajonquière, as, toward the close of Saint-Pierre's journal it is said: "M. de Niverville... gave me an account of what he had learned at the settlement he had made near the Rocky Mountains."

In face of these circumstantial statements it does not seem possible to deny the fact that one of the branches of the Saskatchewan was ascended for some distance in 1751, and that Fort La Jonquière was built there. The questions in doubt are: which branch was ascended; and where was Fort La Jonquière built? As to the former, the evidence is somewhat conflicting. On the one hand, it has been objected that Saint-Pierre's men could not have gone up the South Branch as that would have brought them into the county of the Blackfeet, by whom they inevitably would have been murdered. This opinion is based upon later experiences with the Blackfeet, but as has been seen, the Blackfeet were exceedingly friendly to white men at the time of Hendry's visit, and if this was the case in 1754, it is altogether likely to have been the case in 1751. This argument, therefore, falls to the ground. On the other hand we have the direct statement that the ruins of Fort La Jonquière were found by Captain E. Brisebois, of the North West Mounted Police, at the place where the town of Calgary now stands. "En 1875," says Judge Prud'homme, in his paper already alluded to (I, 72), "la capitaine E. Brisebois, de la police à cheval, fut chargé de bâtir un fort au pied des Montagnes Rocheuses. Il l'érigea sur les bords de la riviére des Arcs, à l'endroit même qu'occupait jadis le fort La Jonquière, dont il retrouva les ruines et lui donna le nom de 'Fort Brisebois' anquel a succédé depuis celui de Calgary." Judge Prud'homme presumably obtained this information from Brisebois himself. In any case, M. Benjamin Sulte says that some years ago Captain Brisebois told him positively that he had discovered the ruins of an old fort, at the place mentioned, which he believed to be those of Fort La Jonquière. A good deal of weight naturally attaches to this direct statement. Yet it can scarcely be regarded as conclusive. Unless Captain Brisebois found among the ruins something that positively identified the building as a French fort - and of this there is no evidence - one would be rather inclined to think it the remains of an old North West Company fort. Remembering the temporary nature of the building erected by Saint-Pierre's men, it is highly improbable that any vestige of it would remain one hundred and twenty-four years afterward. Again, it is to say the least singular that, if a party of French explorers did actually ascend the South Saskatchewan in 1751, Hendry should have heard nothing of it when he visited the Blackfeet three years later, and passed, as far as one can judge, within fifty miles of the place where Fort La Jonquière is said to have been built, just three years before. On the whole, while it seems certain that Fort La Jonquière was actually built, at some point on the upper waters of the Saskatchewan, there is no very convincing proof available in favour of either branch. Until some reasonably conclusive evidence is produced, one may be permitted to keep an open mind, and let the advocates of either branch fight it out among themselves.

One word in conclusion as to Hendry's earlier history. All that we know is contained in a couple of notes, by Andrew Graham, appended to the narrative, "This Anthony Hendey," he says, "was born in the Island of Wight, and was in the year 1748 outlawed for smuggling, and in 1750, entered into the company's Service, the Directors not knowing that he was under sentence of outlawry. This person, whom I knew well, was Bold, enterprising, and voluntarily offered his service to go inland with the natives and explore the country, and to endeavour to draw down the different tribes to the Factory. Before this time none of the servants of the Factories had ventured to winter with the natives. The accounts of horsemen being inland were not credited. He, Hendey, was misrepresented by those in the Bay who were not acting a just part to the Company, and he perceiving not likely to meet with promotion he had so deservedly merited, quitted the Company's service. Which made one of the directors observe afterwards, 'That a valuable servant oftentimes was not known until lost.'" In another note Graham says: "I knew this man; he was a bold and good servant and was drove from the Company's service by the ships gentry because he would not buy slops and brandy from them. He was the first person who ventured inland. I was then writer at York Fort."
