# Journal 1754-1755

JOURNAL OF A JOURNEY PERFORMED BY ANTHONY HENDRY,[^title-1] TO EXPLORE THE COUNTRY INLAND, AND TO ENDEAVOUR TO INCREASE THE HUDSONâ€™S BAY COMPANY'S TRADE, A.D. 1754-1755.

[^title-1]: The name is spelt "Hendey" in a copy of the Journal in the Canadian Archives, of which this is a transcript. Miss Agnes C. Laut says, however, that the Minutes of the Hudson's Bay Company at Hudson's Bay House all spell the name "Hendry." Probably the latter is the correct form.
