[1] Andrew Graham notes: "Anthony Hendry was from York Fort on the 21st day of Nov'r L. ° 59 Wst 810 miles." Presumably this means S. 59° W. Wherever Graham got his information, he was hopelessly at sea. Hendry was, as a matter of fact, at that date, over a thousand miles as the crow flies from York Fort, and had, of course, travelled much more than that distance. If Hendry’s course has been correctly followed, he was, on the 21st day of November, 1754, in about lat. 51° 50' N. long. 114° W. This was his farthest point west. Since crossing the Red Deer and visiting the Blackfeet, he had travelled west, crossed Knee Hills Creek, and worked round in a N.N.W'ly direction to his present postion - only a few miles east of the line of the Calgary & Edmonton Ry. From this date his courses are generally toward the east, though he zigzags about the country of the Blackfeet for five months, waiting for the ice to break up in the spring, as he is to make his return journey by canoe down the Red-Deer and Saskatchewan.
