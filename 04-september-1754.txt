September 1. Sunday. Travelled N.W.b.N. 10 Miles. Rocky hillocks, pleasant valleys, with Birch, Elder, Poplar & Cherry trees, with plenty of fruit. Seven tents of Indians pitched another way. We are yet above 400 in number, two-thirds of whom live chiefly on fruit.

2. Monday. Travelled 12 Miles N.W. Hills and Dales.

3. Tuesday. Travelled none. Young men hunting, killed 3 Moose.

4. Wednesday. Travelled 12 Miles N.W. here Attickasish joined us again, with 2 Archithinue Natives on Horse-back. Level land; killed a great many Waskesew and Moose.

5. Thursday. Travelled 12 Miles West. Level land, with plenty of fruit trees; plenty of Moose, Waskesew, Swans, Cranes, White & Grey Geese, also a few Ducks. We are yet in Muscuty plains [1]. Here are a great many Asinepoet Indians. The Buffalo has taken the route upwards [2] and is the reason we have not yet met with Archithinue Natives.

6: Friday. Travelled W.S.W. 10 Miles. Hillocks and Dales & small ledges of woods all burnt. Indians killed 5 Moose & 2 Waskesow; met with five tents of Mekesue, or Eagle Indians. I gave their leader half a foot if Brazile tobacco, and smoked with them: they were very kind, and made me a present of some tongues, & a bladder full of fat. I could perceive no difference between them and the Asinepoet Natives with regard to the language; but one circumstance surprised me much, and that is, the men do not cover their nakedness; which are the only natives that do not attend to decency. The women are cloathed the same as the other Asinepoet Indians. The Natives inform me that they are a tribe of that brave Nation; and take their name from Eagles being plenty in the district they inhabit. The Leader promised to collect furs, and go down with me to the Fort. They never had traded with any European or Canadian. My Guides & Companions seemed afraid of them [3].

7. Saturday. Travelled 12 Miles W.S.W. land &c. as yesterday. Indians killed 7 Waskesew; found a dead Buffalo; it had been wounded by the Archithinue Natives; several of their Arrows were sticking in it.

8. Sunday. Travelled 10 Miles W.S.W. Level land, and ledges of woods. Indians killed 3 Moose and 4 Waskesew. Saw several pheasants amd Hares.

9. Monday. Travelled 10 Miles W.S.W. over a barren plain, not one drop of water in it; then came to Hommocks of Poplar & Hazle, with a few ponds of water, plenty of Moose & Waskesew.

10. Tuesday. Travelled none. The young men and I went a hunting, killed 3 Moose & 6 Waskesew. I killed a Bull Buffalo, nothing but Skin and bone; took out his tongue, and left his remains to the Wolves who were waiting around me in great numbers: they do not meddle with any person: We cannot afford to expend our ammunition on them. In the evening when we returned home, found we were joined by ten tents of different Indians, but no tidings of the Archithinue Natives. My feet are swelled, but otherwise, Thank God, in perfect health.

11. Wednesday. Travelled 15 Miles W.N.W. Level land; few woods; & plenty of good water. The greatest hardships I have yet exerienced is the Warmness of the weather, and the want of Water. Indians killed 8 Waskesew.

12. Thursday. Cold raw weather which silences the Musquetoes. Travelled 11 Miles W.N.W. hilly, rocky land, and shrubby woods. Indians killed 3 Buffalo & 4 Moose.

13. Friday. Travelled 10 Miles N.W. Level land, no woods. Saw many herds of Buffalo grazing like English Cattle, Indians killed seven. The Bulls will make towards an Indian when wounded: the flesh is sweet but coarse.

14. Saturday. Travelled none. I went with the young men a Bullalo hunting, all armed with Bows & Arrows: killed seven, fine sport. We beat them about, lodging twenty-arrows in one beast. So expert are the Natives, that they will take the arrows out of them when they are foaming and raging with pain, & tearing the ground up with their feet & horns until they fall down.

15. Sunday. Travelled 7 Miles W.S.W. Level land, no woods to be seen: passed by a lake: the Buffalo so numerous obliged to make them sheer out of our way [4]. Also Wolves without number, lurking Indians killed a great many Buffalo; only taking what they choosed to carry. I am now well stocked with tongues. We saw a few Moose & Waskesew; but as the Natives seldom kill them with the Bow & Arrows they will not expend ammunition, while Buffalo are so numerous. I hope we shall soon see the Archithinue Natives; the Horse dung and paths being pretty fresh. Saw a large Snake but could not get at it.

16. Monday. Travelled 5 Miles West, then came to a small river called Chacutenah [5]. It is full of large stones & weeds; small Hazle, Birch & Poplar trees, growing on the sides of it. Buffalo very numerous. Indians killed a great many, only taking out their tongues, and someother choice pieces; leaving the remainder for the Wolves, &c.

17. Tuesday. Indians hunting. Women drying Meat. Two Young Men miserably tore by a Grizzle Bear [6] whom they had wounded. One may recover but the other never can; for his arm is almost tore from his body, one eye is quite out, and his entrails are hanging from his body.

18. Wednesday. Travelled none. One Indian deadand the other in a weak condition. Two Asinepoet Natives came to us and informed us the Archithinue Natives had killed and scalped 6 Indians, and that there wero a great many nigh us.

19. Thursday. Travelled 7 Miles N.W. Level land and ledges of burnt woods. Several ponds of sweet water: left one family to take care of the wouinded man.

20. Friday. Travelled 6 Miles S.W. then came to 7 tents of Asinepoet Natives. I smoked with them and bought a horse from them for a gun, to carry my provisions &c. At night they let the Horses graze with their feet fettered [7].

21. Saturday. Travelled 7 Miles S.W.B.S. Level land and Shrubby woods: Indians killed 12 Waskesew and 3 Buffalo.

22. Sunday. Travelled none. Indians hunting. Indians killed 6 Moose. No Buffalo to be seen. Saw several Wild Horses. The Natives behave very kind to me, except my Guide Attickashish, who is a little out of humour because I would not lend him my gun: but I take no notice, neither do I value him.

23. Monday. Travelled none. Young Men hunting killed 4 Moose & 3 Buffalo; also a large black Bear. Saw several Toads. I cannot describe the fineness of the Weather, and the pleasant country I am now in.

24. Tuesday. Travelled S.W.b.S. 5 Miles. I killed a large Moose, took the heart, & gave the remains to the Indians. Level land and ledges of woods. Saw several Magpies, Pidgeons, and beautiful Woodpeckers. We are yet in Muscuty plains.

25. Wednesday. Travelled 5 Miles West. Level land. Indians killed 6 Moose & 2 Buffalo.

26. Thursday. Travelled 5 Miles W.b.N. Hillocks & Dales. I killed a Moose, and the Indians a good many.

27. Friday. Travelled 7 Miles W.b.N. Ridgy land with hommocks of wood & small Creeks. Indians killed 6 Beaver, 3 Moose and 3 Buffalo. Saw a large smoke which we think are the Archithinue Natives.

28. Saturday. Travelled none. Several tents of Indians joined us: they made me a present of some fat meat and one dryed snake 6 1/2 feet long.

29. Sunday. Travelled none. Women dressing Skins for Shoes. Joined by more Asinepoet Indians, & two Archithinue Natives on Horseback; who informed us it is the Archithinue Smoke we saw: and that it will be eight days before we reach them.

30. Monday. No, Musketoes to trouble us; Travelled 7 Miles W.S.W. Level lands, & small hommocks of woods. Joined by more Asinepoet Indians, who have 6 pack-horses loaded with provisions, &c.

[1] Hendry has been travelling along the south bank of the North Saskatchewan, and is now somewhere about Battleford.

[2] This was always a favourite route of the buffalo, whose deep-worn trails and wallows may still be seen along the banks of the North Saskatchewan.

[3] A note added to the journal, apparently by Andrew Graham, reads: "Since 1755 the Eagle-Eyed Indians have traded annually at York Fort, & are highly valued. When Factor at York Fort I persuaded them to cover their nakedness, at least when at the factory." Arthur Dobbs (“Account of the Countres adjoining to Hudson's Bay," p. 24), says, "The Migichihilinious, that is, Eagle ey'd Indlans, are at 200 leagues distance” (from York Factory). Again (p. 35), quoting Joseph La France, (who made a remarkable journey from Michilimackinac to York Factory, in 1738-41 by way of the Winnipeg country), he says that the Eagie-eyed Indians are so called not because of thelr sharp sight, but on account of the number of eagles that breed on islands in a lake in thelr country. Cocking, who reached the same part of the country through which Hendry is now travelling, early in September, 1772, speaks of certain high lands named Mikisew Wache, or Eagle Hills, and a small stream ealled Mikisew or Little Eagle Creek. Eagle Hills and and Eagle Hills Creek are names well known in the Saskatchewan Valley, the former being applied to a series of hills south of the North Saskatchewan, the creek rising in these hills and empyting into the Saskatchewan above The Elbow. No doubt the tribal name and the place-names had a common origin.

[4] The narratives of early travellers throughout the vast prairie country of North America all bear testimony to the incalculable numbers of the buffalo. Henry the Elder ("Travels amd Adventures in Canada," etc., ed. by James Bain, p, 286) says, “their numbers were so great that we dreaded lest they fairly trample down the camp." Henry the Younger (I, 167) gives an even more graphic picture. "I was awakened," he says, "by the bellowing of buffaloes..... the plains were black, and appeared as if in motion...... I had seen almost incredible numbers of buffalo in the fall, but nothing in comparison to what I now beheld. The ground was covered at every point of the compass, as far as the eye could reach, and every animal was in motion." The accounts of Catlin, Professor Hind, Harmon, Butter, and other writers are to the same effect. See particularly Vol. I of Catlin's "N. A. Indians," pp. 247 to end of volume. The late Dr. Selwyn travelled over a portion of the same country explored by Hendry in 1873. "Not many years ago," he says, "the region we traversed was swarming with buffaloes; now, thelr skulls whitening on the plain, and the deep-worn and grass-grown tracks which traverse the prairies in all directions, are the only evidence of their former existence.” (Geol. Survey 1873-4, p. 61). Mr. W.T. Hornaday has gone very fully into the whole history of this remarkable animal in his "Extermination of the Buffalo" and Ernest Thompson Seton adds some further detalls in an article on "The American Bison," (Scribner's Magazine, Oct., 1906). Interesting particulars as to the buffalo pounds will be found in Bain's Henry (301); Coues’ Henry-Thompson (518-20, 576-77); Paul Kane's "Wanderings of an Artist," etc. (117-18); and many other writers. An excellent illustration of a pound will be found in Hind's "Canadian Red River Exp. Exp'n." etc. I. 858; wile, in addition to the familiar account in Parkman's "Oregon Trail," an admirable description of the more sportsmanlike mithod of hunting the buffalo in the open on horseback, will be found in Catlin (I. 199-20).

[5] Sounding Creek, between 110° and 111° W. long. In Lieut. Chappell's Vocabulary of the Cree or Knisteneaux Indians ("Narrative of a Voyage to Hudson's Bay," 257) Chah-kiet-tin-now is defined as A hill, rising ground; and in the vocabulary in Henry the Youger's Journal (525), hill is given as Tchacutinnow. Neutral Hills, between Sounding Creek and Ribstone Creek, may suggest the origin of Henry's Chacutenah.

[6] The grizzly bear, though popularly supposed to be confined to the Rocky Mountains, has ranged over a much wider field. Cocking speaks of "grizzle bears of the fierce kind" east of the South Saskatchewan; Henry the Younger (121) says they were abundant Jn the Hair Hills and at Lac du Diable, in the Red River Valley. They are mentioned in the narrative of Henry Kellsey, who journeyed inland trom Hudson's Bay, in 1691 or 1692; and Samuel Hearne found them east of the Coppermine. The ferocity of the species is too well known to need comment.

[7] This, and the reference on the 22nd to wild horses, raises the interesting point - already discussed briefly in the Introduction, in connection with the Blackfeet - when the horse first came into use among the Assiniboines. Hendry's journal would indicate that the horse had aleeady become, in 1754, the indispensible companion of the Indian of the plains. Yet it 1s clear from La Vérendrye's Journal of the Expedition to the Mandans (p 13, Canadian Arvhives Report, 1889), that horses were not in use among the Assiniboines in 1738-39, at any rate among those who inhabited the country between the Assiniboine and the Missouri. It would appear that the horse, introduced into America by the Spaniards, was first adopted by the tribes of the Southwest, its use gradually spreading north to the Missouri. There the Blackfeet no doubt first acquired them. From the Blackfeet they were introduced among the western Assiniboines, and finally reached their kinsmen in the Red River country.
