## October 1754

October 1. Tuesday. Travelled none. Came to us 7 tents of Archithinue Indians; the men all mounted on Horse-back, with Bows and Arrows, & bone spears & darts. I gave the Leader a foot of tobacco, one fire Steel, a string of beads, a knife; and smoked with them. By my interpreter he said that he would inform the Great Leader of my coming & so left us.

October 2. Wednesday. Travelled 7 Miles S.W. Level land. In the evening an Asinepoet Indian shot a Boy by accident. Saw several wild Goats. My feet a little swelled.

October 3. Thursday. Travelled 12 Miles W.S.W. passed 2 Creeks where were growing the largest Pines and Birch trees I have yet seen. Indians killed 6 Buffalo, 2 Moose and three Beaver.

October 4. Friday. Travelled W.S.W. 5 Miles. Hillocks, Dales and Willows; plenty of water ponds; Buffalo in great droves; Indians killed 5 & I one.

October 5. Saturday. Went 6 Miles W.S.W. Level land and no woods; passed two creeks, & several Iron Mines running in large long veins. Great plenty of Buffalo. We are still in the Muscuty Country.

October 6. Sunday. Travelled 7 Miles S.W. Several Creeks with plenty of Beaver; Indians killed 28 Buffalo. They are not so large as those I first met with. Two young men brought in 3 Goats; they are not so large as the Welsh ones.

October 7. Monday. Travelled none. Several Indians joined us. I was invited to a Beaver feast; Saw the Archithinue Smoke. Here is a ridge of fine flint stone.

October 8. Tuesday. Travelled 7 Miles S.W. pleasant valleys, hillocks, & ledges of woods. Indians killed a great many Buffalo, took out the tongues & left the remains to be eat by the Wolves. I cannot say whether them or the Buffalo are most numerous. Saw several snakes.

October 9. Wednesday. Travelled 5 Miles S.W.b.W. Level land with plenty of Creeks, 16 tents of different Natives pitched from us different ways. Indians killed many Buffalo.

October 10. Thursday. Travelled none. Indians killed several Beaver for cloathing, as cold weather is approaching. 16 Beaver were taken out of one house. They are very numerous about the Creeks.

October 11. Friday, Travelled 7 Miles S.W.b.W. then came to Waskesew River,[^october-1754-1] and crossed it on a Fall about two feet high, and much the same depth, & 20 poles wide. On both sides there are stones of different sizes & weight; quite round, and of an iron color; and a little distance from the River, are veins of iron-ore running along the surface of the ground. No woods to be seen. Indians killed several Beaver and 2 Moose.

[^october-1754-1]: Red Deer River. Mr. D. B. Dowling, of the Geological Survey, who is thoroughly familiar with this part of the Northwest, and whose assistance has been invaluable in tracing Hendry's course across the plains, confidently identifies Hendry's Waskesew river as the Red Deer, and is satisfied that the explorer crossed the Red Deer, on Oct. 11th, a little above Knee Hills Creek (51Â° 32'). The ironstone nodules mentioned by Hendry are found in this locality, though not peculiar to it. Dr. Selwyn, in his exploratory survey of 1873, found them in abundance on the South Saskatchewan, about 80 miles above the Forks; Dr. Robert Bell mentions them the same year around the Dirt Hills, east of the Elbow of the South Saskatchewan; and Dr. R. W. Ells collected specimens in 1875 on the North Saskatchewan, between Edmonton and Victoria.

October 12. Saturday. Travelled 8 Miles S.W.b.W. Level land; plenty of water; & ledges of woods. Indians killed a great many Buffalo.

October 13. Sunday. Travelled 7 Miles S.W.b.W. Level land, and ledges of woods; and numbers of Buffalo. Indians killed a great many. In the evening we were joined by 7 Archithinue Natives on Horse-back, who informed us we should see the Great Leader, & numbers of Archithinue Natives to-morrow.[^october-1754-2]

[^october-1754-2]: See Introduction for remarks on the Blackfeet. Some interesting particulars will also be found in Catlin, I, 29 et seq.

October 14. Monday. Travelled 4 Miles S.W.b.W. Then came to us four men on Horse-back; they told us they were sent from the main body to see whether we were Friends or Enemies. We told them we were Friends. Attickasish, Canawappaw, Cokamanakisish, and the other of our Leaders walked in front about 4 Miles farther then we; came to 200 tents of Archithinue Natives, pitched in two rows, and an opening in the middle; where we were conducted to the Leader's tent; which was at one end, large enough to contain fifty persons; where he received us seated on a clear (white) Buffalo skin,[^october-1754-3] attended by 20 elderly men. He made signs for me to sit down on his right hand; which I did. Our Leader set on several grand-pipes, and smoked all round, according to their usual custom; not a word was yet spoke on either side. Smoking being over, Buffalo flesh boiled was served round in baskets of a species of bent, and I was presented with 10 Buffalo tongues. Attickasish my Guide, informed him I was sent by the Great Leader who lives down at the great waters, to invite his young men down to see him and to bring with them Beaver skins, & Wolves skins; & they would get in return Powder, Shot, Guns, Cloth, Beads, &c. He made little answer; only said that it was far off, & they could not paddle. Then they entered upon indifferent subjects until we were ordered to depart to our tents, which were pitched about a full quarter of a Mile without their lines.

[^october-1754-3]: "A white buffalo robe," says Catlin ("North American Indians," I, 134), "is a great curiosity, even in the country of buffaloes, and will always command an almost incredible price, from its extreme scarcity; and then, from its being the most costly article of traffic in these regions, it is usually converted into a sacrifice, being offered to the Great Spirit as the most acceptable gift that can be procured. Amongst the vast herds of buffaloes which graze on these boundless prairies, there is not one in a hundred thousand, perhaps, that is white; and when such an one is obtained, it is considered great medicine or mystery."

October 15. Tuesday. Froze a little last night. Our women employed dressing Beaver skins for cloathing. About 10 o'clock A.M. I was invited to the Archithinue Leader's tent; when by an interpreter I told him what I was sent for, & desired of him to allow some of his young men to go down to the Fort with me, where they would be kindly received, and get Guns &c. But he answered, it was far off, & they could not live without Buffalo flesh; and that they could not leave their horses &c; and many other obstacles, though all might be got over if they were acquainted with a Canoe, and could eat Fish, which they never do. The Chief further sald they never wanted food, as they followed the Buffalo & killed them with the Bows and Arrows; and he was informed the Natives that frequented the Settlements, were oftentimes starved on their journey.[^october-1754-4] Such remarks I thought exceeding true. He made me a present of a handsome Bow & Arrows, & in return I gave him a part of each kinds of goods I had, as ordered by Mr. Isham's written instructions. I departed and took a view of the camp. Their tents were pitched close to one-another in two regular lines, which formed a broad street open at both ends. Their horses are turned out to grass, their legs being fettered; and when wanted, are fastened to lines cut of Buffalo skin, that stretches along & is fastened to stakes drove in the ground. They have hair halters, Buffalo skin pads, & stirrups of the same. The horses are fine tractible animals, about 14 hands high; lively and clean made. The Natives are good Horsemen, & kill the Buffalo on them. These Natives are drest much the same as others; but more clean & sprightly. They think nothing of my tobacco; & I set as little value on theirs; which is dryed Horse-dung.[^october-1754-5] They appear to be under proper discipline, & obedient to their Leader; who orders a party of Horsemen Evening & Morning to reconitre;[^october-1754-6] and proper parties to bring in provisions. They have other Natives Horsemen as well as Foot, who are their Enemies; they are also called the Archithinue Indians; & by what I can learn talk the same language, & hath the same customs. They are, like the other Natives murthering one another slyly. Saw many fine Girls who were Captives; & a great many dried Scalps with fine long black hair, displayed on poles, & before the Leader's tent. They follow the Buffalo from place to place; & that they should not be surprised by the Enemy, encamp in open plains. Their fuel is turf, & Horse-dung dryed; their cloathing is finely painted with red paint; like unto English Ochre; but they do not mark nor paint their bodies. Saw four Asses.

[^october-1754-4]: This native philosophy may be matched with the eloquent reply recorded of a Mandan Indian, in Charles Mackenzie's Missouri Journal (Masson's "Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nord-Ouest," p. 331); "White people do not know how to live," said this shrewd Mandan, "they leave their houses in small parties, they risk their lives on the great waters among strange nations who will take them for enemies. What is the use of beaver? Do they make gunpowder of them? Do they preserve them from sickness? Do they serve them beyond the grave?" "We are no Slaves!" continued the Chief. "Our fathers were not Slaves! In my young days there were no white people, and we knew no wants; we were successful in war; our arrows were mortal; our villages rejoiced when the men returned from war, for of the scalps of our enemies they brought many. The white people came; they brought with them some good; but they brought the small-pox; and they brought evil liquors; the Indians since diminish, and they are no longer happy."

[^october-1754-5]: Hendry may have been under a misapprehension as to the nature of the "tobacco" smoked by the Blackfeet. Certainly In 1872 they smoked the native tobacco, common to all the tribes of the plains. "The natives shew me," says Cocking, "a tobacco plantation belonging to the Archithinue Indians, about 100 yards long & 5 wide, sheltered from the northern blasts by a ledge of poplars: & to the Southward by a ridge of high ground." La Verendeye, in the journal of his trip to the Mandans in 1738-39, mentions that tobacco was then grown on the Missouri - "Leste blee et tabac au bas de la riviere." When he approached the first Mandan village, messengers met him and presented him with the calumet. "When Alexander Henry, the Younger, visited the Mandans in 1806, he was presented with native tobacco. As the herb was not yet arrived at maturity (it was toward the end of July) the natives used only the blossoms. "These," he says, "are collected as required, dried before the fire on a fragment of an earthen pot, and smoked by all the natives. But I find the flowers a very poor substitute for our own tobacco - a nauseous, insipid weed. The ripe leaf is somewhat better, but even that is mere trash, possessed of neither strength nor virtue." This native tobacco was *Nicotiana quadrivalois*. Prince Maximilian says that the Missouri Indians smoked "the leaves of the tobacco plant, which is cultivated by them; the bark of the red willow (*Cornus serrica*), which they obtain from the traders, is sometimes mixed with the tobacco, or with the leaves of the bearberry (*Arbutus ura ursi*). The tobacco of the White, unmixed, is too strong for the Indians, because they draw the smoke into their lungs: hence they do not willingly smoke cigars." He adds: "the tobacco cultivated by the Mandans, Manitaries and Arikkaras, attains a great height, and is suffered to grow up from the seeds, without having any care whatever bestowed upon it." Although buffalo-dung, known among the fur-trades as *bois de vache*, was always used more or less as fuel by the Indians of the plains, when wood was unobtainable, no other traveller seems to have recorded its use as a substitute for tobacco.

October 16. Wednesday. Women employed as yesterday. With the Leader's permission, I rode a hunting with twenty of his young men. They killed 8 Buffalo, excellent sport. They are so expert that with one, or two, arrows they will drop a Buffalo. As for me I had sufficient employ to manage my horse. When I came home I was invited to the Leader's tent again where were all the Asinepoet Leaders, etc. I thought it very curious as there were four different languages among us. The Leader gave orders to pitch away from him, and that we would see him again in the Spring, when they came down after the Buffalo. He gave one of the Leaders two young slaves as a present and 40 Buffalo tongues; they were both girls.[^october-1754-7]

[^october-1754-7]: Andrew Graham notes, under date, 1765, "One of them was murthered at York Fort by a Home-Native in a fit of jealousy.
