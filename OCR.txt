The Journal of Anthony Hendry; 1754-55. 
Edited by Lawnexes J. BURPES, and Regd May 15, 1907. 
In its evidence before the parliamentary committee of 1749 the 
Hudson's Bay Company was,compelled to fall back upon the vague 
/ wanderings of Henry Kellsey, in the previous century, to bolster up its 
| contention that it had been true-to the implied obligationé of its charter 
| that is to say, that it had promoted the exploration of the vast territory 
granted by King Charles the Second. It was part of the irony of 
(circumstances that only five years gijgr the publication of the commit- 
e's report a really effective argument was furnished, on behalf of the 
pany, by the expedition of Anthony Hendry. 
“Sqn impartial analysis of Kellsey’s: journal leaves the impression 
that the company’s case would have, beon very little weakened by its 
omission\ It has been claimed for Kellsey that on this journey 
“of 1691 ot\1692 he reached the Seskatchewan country. Dr. Elliott 
Cones even ‘went so far as to cay that “Kellsey was on Lake 
Winnipeg in July and ‘August, 1692. ‘The statement was made at 
recond hand. - TiNDr. Coues had kept to his usual careful practice of 
relying only pon the original documents, he would have found that 
there is nothing whatever in Kellsey’s journal to support such a conten- 
tion. Neither is there dy satisfactory proof tliat he reached. the Sas- 
‘atchewan, or was at ‘ny tine within the valley of the Saskatchewan. 
His distances and directions yad his descriptions of the country tra- 
versed, so far as they suggest anything, yather go to show that his route 
lay toward South Indian lake or Granville Jake, on the’ waters of the 
Churchill. ‘The whole narrative, however, especially in the light of eur- 
rounding circumstances, is too unsubstyntial to afford any safe ground 
for historical conclusions, 
The case of Anthony Hendry is entirdly different: It is possible to 
follow him ahinost step by step, fom tho titge he léft York Factory, in 
Tune, 1754, until he returned to it in-Tune’ ol the following year. Dur- 
ing that period of nearly twelve months this\plucky young fur-trader 
travelled, with no white companion, a thousand \niles inland, from York 
Factory to the upper waters of the South Sdskktchewan, wintering in 
the country of the feree Blackfeet, and returning Mi safety to the, shores 
of the bay. In the course of his journey he triversed an immense

‘Bfndry was the actual discoverer of the South Saskatchewan, Certainly 
his is the firs} unquestionably authentic description of the river, as well 
as of thé’ great plain lying between the North and South Saskatchewan. 
After leaving York Factory, Hendry’s course lay up the Hayes 
river to what was then called Attick-Sagohan or Deer Lake, now known 
a5 Knee lake, Even this far there is no record of any earlier explora- 
tion, though it is quite possible that spre of the menof the Hudson's 
Bay Company may have reached Kneb or Oxford likes on trading ex- 
editions, There fs a note, however, on the margif, of Hendiy’s journal, 
by Andrew Graham, afterward fagtor at Yorkjin which the signifiqant 
statement is made that Hendry was “the first person who ‘ventired™ 
inland.” This lends at least some colour to the argument, advanced 
by opponents of the company, that the whole story of Kellsey’s journey 
Was a fabrication, 
From Knee lake it becomes for a time a little more difficult to fol- 
low Hendry’s movements. ‘The natural supposition would be that he 
followed the aftetwards familiar. route by way of Oxford lake, Echima- , 
mish river and the Playgreen lakes to Lake Winnipeg ; and this suppos': 
tion gains support from the fact that he presently mentions a lake which 
he ealls Christianaux—one of the old French names for Lake Winnipeg.* 
His distanées, however, put such a theory out of court; and evén if that 
were not The case, Isis, description of Christianaux lake cannot be made 
to fit Winnipeg. He makes the explicit statement that in crossing the 
lake he “ passed 22 woody islands.” As everyone knows, the northern 
end of Lake Winnipeg is singularly free of islands. On the other hand, 
it took him two days to cross Christianaux lalgj-and he makes the dis- 
tance fifty-one miles. Admitting that his distances may ave been some- 
what exaggerated, (and as will be seen presently the probabilities point 
the other way), there is no lake of this size—on the maps—anywhere 
between York Factory and Lake Winnipeg. It happens, however, that 
between Knee and Oxford lekes and Cross lake on the Nelson lies a cou- 
siderable extent of country that his never been explored; or rather ‘t 
‘was supposed that it had never been explored. One or two small lakes 
appear-on the maps, but they «re purely conjectural.” Both the Nelson 
river and the Hayes route have been carefully surveyed in recent years, 
but no officer of the Geological Survey has ever yet traversed the country 
between Oxford lake and the Nelson. So far as was known, up toa short 
time’ago, no direct canoe route existed from Oxford lake to the Nelson.

In the summer of 1906, however, Mr. Owen O'Sullivan of the Survey 
met at Oxford House the Rev. Mr. Banel, a missionary, who had just 
come by canoe from his headquarters on Cross lake to Osfotd, and 
had discovered about midway an unmapped lake, so large that he had 
bbeen lost upon it for three days. ‘The lake was described as being about 
a day's journey from Oxford lake. ‘There does not seomto be any rea- 
sonable doubt that ihe lake discovered by Father Banet is the same tra- 
versed by Hendry in 1754, and named by him Christianbux. 
In tracing Hendry’s route throughout all this early -part of his 
journey much help is derived from @ comparison of his journal with 
that of another officer of the Hudson’s Bay Company, Mathew Cocking, 
who journeyed inland from York Factory in 1772. Cocking’s Deer lake 
is, beyond reasonable question, Hendry’s ‘Attick-Sagohai—present Knee 
, lake; and the latter’s Christidnaux Inke becomes’ Pimochickomow in 
Cocking’s narrative. Cocking notes the fact that there are “many 
{islands in the lake,” and gives his distance through the lake as sixty- 
five miles, from which it would appear that Hendry underestimated 
rather than exaggerated the length of the lake. 
Leaving Christianaux lake, Hendry’ apparently took the samae river 
to Cross lake followed by Father Banel, For some reaéon he makes no 
special mention of Cross lake, but says that he “ took his departure from 
Shad fall” and paddled up a river. This river is given in Cock‘ug's 
journal as the Minahage or Pine river—the Minago of our moder « 
‘maps. ‘Ascending this stream he came to a large lake, which he calls 
Othenume, afd Cocking, Oteatowan Sockoogan; evidently Moose lake. 
Both Hendry’s’and Cocking’s descriptions agree with recent accounts 
of Moose lake. Paddling up a river emptying into Moose Jake, Hendry 
finally reached the Saskatchewan, or Keiskotchewan as he spels it, and 
thé following day came to a French house, Fort “Basques,” at the 
mouth of the Pasquia river. 
This place, now known as The Pas, was a notable spot throughout 
the entire period of the fur-trado, from the days of La Vérendrye down 
The elder La Vérendrye, so far as his journals and letters show, was 
never on the Saskatchewan, but one of his cons built Fort Bourbdn on 
fhe shores of Cedar lake, about 1748, and ascended the river. as far 9s 
the forks, somewhere below which he built Fort Poskoyac. After the 
death of the élder La Vérendrye, in 1749, Jacques Legardeur de Seint- 
Pierre was sent’out to continue his explorations in the far west. A 
party of his men are said to haye ascended one of the branches of the 
Saskatchewan to the: foot of the Rocky Mountains, in 1751, and built 
there Fort La Jonquitre. This will be referred to again. “Two years 
later Saint:Luc de La Corne, who had been sent to replace Saint-Pierre,

“is said to have built Fort Poskoyae—fort Poskoyac the second—on the 
lower Saskatchewath:, In a paper read before the Society (B.S.C., 1906, 
pt. I), Judge Prud’homme furnishes a very ingenious identification of 
. the various French forts built, or said to have been built, on the ‘Sas-, 
~ . eichewan, He enumerates six: Forts Bourbon and Poskoyac, built by 
the La Vérendrye; Fort Ia Jonquidre, built,by de Niverville’s men; 
and Forts La Corne, Poskoyac and Pasquia (Poste Pasquia), by Saint- 
Tue de LaCorne. . ‘Of these, he says that Fort Bourbon was situated 
upon-Cedar Jake, and La Jonguiére on the upper Saskatchewan. The 
two Forts Poskoyae were on the lower Saskatchewan; La Vérendrye’s 
Poskoyae, near the Forks of the Saskatchewan ;. La Corne’s.tort of the 
same narie, at the-entrance to Cumberland Lake; Fort La Corne some 
distance befow the Forks; and Poste Pasquia on the Carrot river. . 
‘The late Dr. Elliott’Coues, in one of his foot-notes to the Henry- 
Thompson Journals (‘ New Light on the Early History of the Greater 
Northwest,” I1,-469), says that ‘The Pas, close to the mouth of the 
Pasquia River, was the location of old Fort Poskoyac or Poscoiac. We* 
have the evidence of both Hendry’s Journal and the Journal of Cocking 
to prove that a French fort existed at or near the ipenth of the Pasquia 
Rivet. The former establislige the presence of a second French fort, 
between the mouth of the Paggnia and the Forks of the Saskatchewap— 
in fact not very, many miles,Selow the Forks. Hendry gives no name 
to this upper fort, but mentions that it was “subordinate to Basquia.? 
Cocking, paddling up the Saskitchewan in 1772, left Basquio on = > 
August Ist, and ten days later reached a point on the river.whére the 
families of his Indian guides vere awaiting them. “Formerly,” he 
notes in hiswemmal, “ the French‘had a House here... From Basquit 
to this place I make the course to ie 8. 88° W, and distaneé 150 miles.” 
Three days before, that is on the Sth of the month, he had passed “an 
old Trading House belonging to the French, pedlars before the gonguest 
of Quebec,” This was about 92 niles from Bagguia, and 58 miles from 
the upper fort. Cocking, therefote, gives us thrée, French posts between 
Phe ‘Pas and the Forks. Hendry for some mpaton does not mention 
the middle fost. Possibly-he-pmsced the spit after dark; or may have 
been hugging the'other.bank of the: river atd_so missed it; or, again,

Of these thrée forts, we know that the/lower #rgs situated at the 
inouth of the ‘Pasquia. 'Thete is less offBinty-as to the position of the 
other two, Judge Prad’homme says of the upper one: “ Fort La Corne,

(ouares] YORK FACTORY TO THE BRACKFEET COUNTRY sil 
tion, Sir Alexander Mackenzie says that the French had an establish- 
ment at Nipawi Jong before and at the conquest of Canada in 1763. In 
tho Jounal. of Alexander Henry, the Younger, it is stated (p. 482) 
that he “camped at the spot where the French formerly had an estab- 
Lishment called Fort Saint-Louis, built by Saint-Luc de la Corne in a 
Jow bottom on the S. side, where some years ago were still to be-seen 
remains of agricultural iniplements and carriage-wheels, Their roa 
fo the plains is Still to be seen, winding Yp'divalhyton the S'side” 
In foot-hotes to the Henry-Thompson Journals (pp. 4813), Dr-Coties 
clearly identifies’ the position of this old ¥revich fort—La Corne, & la 
Corne, de la Corne, St. Louis, Nipawi; Nippeween, as it was variously 
called—as within the present Indian reserve, close to.or at the mouth, 
of Payoeran er, and thus about 12 m, in an air line below the forks— 
auch more by the bends of tha river. ‘The position is about the center 
sof Tp. 48, R. xx, W. of thé-2d init, mirid.” 
From Cocking’s dvécription of the river above Pasquia it is zeason- 
ably'certain that the point he reached on August 11th, and where he 
says the French formerly had a House, was the site of Fort La Corne, 
although his distances are in that event far astray, He makes the dis- 
tance from Pasquia to this point 150 miles, Jolin Fleming, who sur. 
  
veyed-the river from Fort La Corne to The Pas in 1858 (Hind’s  Nar- * 
rative of the Canadian Red River Expedition,” etc., I, ch. XXI.), makes 
the distance about 213 miles. 
+ As to the third French post, betwoon Fort Le Corne and Fort 
Poskoyae, this would seem to be Judge Prud’homme’s Fort Poskoyas 
(the second), “appelé aussi Frangais, fondé.i Ventrée du lac. Cumber- 
land par M.‘de la Corne, entre 1753 et 1755”; but if so, it could not. 
have been situated at the entrance to Cumberland Lake. Fleming makes 
the distance from ‘The Pas to Cumberland Lake 63 miles. Cocking 
mentions a carrying-place, on the north side-of the river, into'a lake 
named Menistaquatakow, which he makes 52 miles from Pasquia.- As 
he appatently, took a short cut across Saskéram Lake, and thus avoided 
the. deep bend in'the river north of that lake, his distances would about 
agree with those of Fleming, and his Menistaquatakow would be Cum- 
berland Lake. But the “old Trading House belonging to the French 
pedlars,” which he passed on August sth, was about 58 miles above 
Menistaquatakow Lake: In the interval he had passed 2 small branch 
on the south side of the Saskatchewan which “ joins the river a little 
above Basyuia”—clearly Sipanok Canal, which runs almost due east 
‘to Carrot:River, the latter joining the Saskatchewan a little above the 
Pasquia. From Sipanok Canal to the old fort Cocking’s distance is 
about 27 miles. 'A few miles heldw the fort he passed the mouth of a 
  
    
aig "ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA 
branch bearing S. by E., which he'calls Peatagow River. On Fleming's 
” map (Hind’s “Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition, 
1858”), a small stream is shown entering the Saskatchewan from the 
south-east, about 103° 55’. As the middle post was about ten miles above 
Peatagow River, we will be reasonably safe in placing it in long. 104°. 
Whether or not this was the fort which Judge Prud’homme calls Fort 
Poskoyae le second, built by La Corne between 1753 and 1755, it is 
impossible to say. It certainly is nowhere near the site fixed by Judge 
Prudhomme. 
We have, then, the evidence of oth Hendry and Cocking as to the 
existence of two French posts on the Saskatchewan, between the Forks 
nd The Pas; and Cocking bears witness to the presence of a third. 
With the exception of Fort La Corne, however, it is impossible to-re- 
= eoncile Judge Prud’homme’s descriptions with the evidence of these 
carly explorers, Hendry visited the French post at the mouth of the 
Pasquia in 1754-55, and says of it, “This House has been long acplace 
of Trade belonging to the French.” Judge Prud’homme dates the three 
posts below the Forks between 1758 and 1755; that is to say, just about 
the time of Hendry’s visit. . 
‘To sum up, the evidence afforded by these two journals goes to show 
that/there were three French posts on the Saskatchewan between The 
Pas and the Forks. Of these the oldest was that at The Pas, or the 
mouth of the Pasquia, built by the Chevalier de La Vérendrye about 
1748. The other two, built by Saint-Ime de La Come, were minor 
posts; the first situated about 104°; and the upper post—Fort La Come 
about 104° 32’. FortTa Corne was built in 1753; the lower fort may 
have been-built after Hendry descended the river in 1755. 
‘As Hendry is the only British explorer or trader known to have 
visited Fort Poskoyae, or indeed any of the French forts west of Lake 
“Superior, up to, the close of-the period of French rule in Canada, his 
description of the fort, with the account of his meeting with the French 
traders, is of exceptional value. 
In this connection the following, from Robson’s “Account of Six 
years residence in Hudson’s-Bay” (pp. 62-63), is of interest: “Ib is 
universally believed among the servants, that the Frgnch travel many 
hundred miles over land from Canada to the heads of our rivers in 
the Bay, and that they have erected huts and settled a considerable 
factory upon a lake°at the head of Nelson-river; trading with the 
natives for the lightest and most, valuable furs, which. they carry a 
long way before they find a conveyance by water; and this general 
opinion is tiot taken up at random, but supported by particular incon- 
testable evidences of the-fact T have seen French guns among the 
 
(avnras} YORK FACTORY 19 THE BLACKFEET COUNTRY 919 
  
natives that-come to Yorksfort; and once heard Mr. Brady, the sur 
‘goon, converse with one of them in the French language, I have also 
frequently seen in the governor's hand, a letter addressed to him from 
the chief factor at the ‘French’ settlement on Nelson-river. It was 
written in French and Indian; and the purport of it was to vstablish 
1 trade between them and the English at York-fort,, for those heay 
goods which the French stood in great need of, but could not bring from 
Canads, suck as guns, Kettles, tobacco, &e., and the English wete 
desired to say, how siuch beaver they expected in exchange for these 
articles. ‘Tho governor told us, that he had sent a copy of the letter 
to England; and added, that if the Company consented to such a treaty, 
ve should get no furs but what came through the hands of the French, 
who would soon have huts all the way down Nelson-river. 
“The linguists informed me, that they have-had a description of 
the Fyench factory at the head of Nelson-river from different Indians, 
who all agreed in the principal circumstances, and remarkably in this, 
that the Fronch have a Jarge boat or sloop upon the lake. ‘These 
people formerly would have ‘been glad to’have had the English accom- 
pany them up the rivers; and were once very solicitous to engage us 
4o Yo up, that we might head them against the French Indians; -but 
they are now very easy and silent upon that subject; the French by 
kind offices and a liberality in dealing, which we think of no conse- 
quence, have obtained so much influence over almost all the natives, 
that many of them are actually turned factors-for the French at our 
settlements for heavy goods. ‘This the Indians openly acknowledged 
to the linguist in the year 1746, just before I left York-fort.” 
After Hendry’s day the ruins of the old fort are constantly referred 
to by explorers and traders who passed them on their way xip the Saskat~ 
chewan, When Cocking went up in 1772 he mientions .Basquia as a 
“Jong frequented place where the Canadians rendezvous and-trade with 
the natives.” ‘Three years later, Alexander Henry, the elder, with, Joseph 
and Thomas Frobisher and the notorious. Peter Pond, landed at a Cree 
encampment on the Pasquia a little above its mouth, and therefore not 
for from the site of Fort Poskoyae. ‘The traders were politely enter- 
tained by a crafty old Indian river-baron named Chatiqne, who laid 
tribute upon all that tifey had, comforting ther with the assurance that 
if they dia not pay up cheerfully he would take their lives aswell as 
their possessions. Alexander Henrv’s nephew and naiesake passed the 
mouth of the Pasquia, or the little river of Montagne du Pas,”-as he 
Zalls it, in 1808, and mentions that some traces of the old French estah- 
lishment were even then visible. '

‘Hendry has reached the Saskatchewan, and before speaking of his 
further explorations, it may be in place to point out that he was’ the 
first British trader upon” the waters of that great highway of the west. 
‘There has been a widespread impression, based upon Alexander Mac- 
kenzie’s statements in his History of the Fur Trade, that the first British 
traders who reached the Saskatchewan came from Montreal. “In 1770,” 
says Dr. Coues, “‘Thomas-Curry, of Montreal, journeyed to Foit Bour- 
don, with guides, interpreters, and four canoes and wintered 1770-71. 
‘This pioncer of all the English traders was satisfied with his venture, 
and mever repeated it; but he was immediately succeeded by James 
Finlay, who in 1771 went as far as Nipawi, then the last French settle: 
ment on the Saskatchewan.” Curry and Finlay may be regarded as the 
scouts of that great fur-trading enterprise that afterward became known: 
as the North Wést Coimpany. ‘The men of the North West Company 
are entitled to the credit of widespread explorations in the west, but the 
honour of first reaching the Saskatchewan undoubtedly belongs to a 
Hudson’s Bay man, Anthony Hendry. . 
+ There seems, too, to have been some misundersténding as to the 
relative claims of Curry and, Finlay, for we learn from Coéking that 
Finlay was on the Saskatchewan at leist as early as 1767. In paddling 
up the river, from Pasquia to the Forks, Cocking passed, the ruins of a 
trading post in which, he saygp One Mr. Finlay, of Montreal, resided 
five years ago.” Cocking passed the place in August, 1772. Under date 
of July 23rd of the same year he notes in his journal, “The Pedlar. 
Mr. Currie’ (who intercepted great part of York Fort trade this year) 
is one.day’s paddling below this river, at Cedar Lake”; and Andrew 
Graham, the Factor, adds in a footnote: “Mr. Currie’s encroachments 
‘was the reason I sent Mr. Cocking inland.” This confirms Dr. Coues’ 
statement that Curry, or Currie, was somewhere on the lower waters of 
the Saskatchewan in 1771, but it is evident that he did not return, that 
yeat, ax he was at Cedar Lake in August, 1772; and five years earlier 
Finlay was not merely on the Saskatchewan, but had built a trading 
ost well up toward the Forks. 
‘To return to Anthony Hendry and his journal.’ After he left Fort 
Poskoyse his course lay for.a few iniles up the Saskatchewan; six miles, 
secording to his journal. ‘Then he left the river and paddled sixteen 
miles across a lake on the south side. This could only be Saskeram 
Jake, Then, he says, he came to Peatago river, which he ascended for 
fifty-five miles, until he could get no farther, and decided to abandon 
his canoe. and travel overland. One would naturally suppose that his 
river must be the small stream that enters the western end of Saskeram 
Jake} but the distance travelled puts this out of the question. ‘The maps

informed by Mr. D. B. Dowling, ‘of the Geological Survey, to whom I

after he left the main Sestaihotan, ‘that in periods of high wate a

day he reached ‘the Saskatchewan. When he comes to the Waskesew 
the cgse is even-worse. In a foot-note Andrew Graham informs us that 
“Keskatchew and Waskesew River is all one river, and is called by the 
French Christiantux River, from the lake of that name.” Undoubt- 
edly the Red Deer and the Saskatchewan are all one river, but Hendry 
has already Grossed the South Saskatchewan and seen the.North Saskal- 
chewan, Why did he not iame them Keskateliew or Waskesew? Again, 
here is the old Frenéh name Christianaux applied to the Saskateliewan, 
and fo Lake Winnipeg.’ Hendry crossed a lake which hé names Chris 
tianaws, and which by no possible manipulation of ‘his distances can. 
be made to fit Lake Winnipeg. It is morally certain that he never 
saw Lake Winnipeg on either his outward or return journey. One is 
reduced to the conclusion that either he or Graham confused the large 
lake-Which he crossed, and Which’ he named Chrstianans, with Lake 
Winnipeg. 
‘Three days. after crossing the Red Deer, Hendry arrived at a large 
camp of Archithinue Indians. The name occurs repeatedly in his nar- 
ative, dhd one of the chief objects of his-journey seems to.have been to 
get Yn touch with this tribe and induce them to briny furs down 
to York Factory. It would be impossible to identify the tribe with 
any degige of certainty were it not that Cocking supplics the. key. 
He, too, visited the Avehithinues| and.in his Journal. under date of 
Deceinbier Ist, 1772, he says; “Thil-tribe is, named Powestic-Athinue-

a ‘The information as to the Blackfeet and their manner of living, . 
at the time white men first went among them, ds contained im the jour- 
nals of Hendiy and Cocking, may.be taken to correct the inaccurate 
statements of later writers, based. upon insufficient evidence, For in- 
stance, George Bird Grinnell, in his “Blackfoot Lodge Tales,” says 
that “in ancient times it [fire] was obtained by means of fire sticks.... ~ 
1 The starting of the spark with these sticks is said to have been hari 
work., At almost’ their first meeting with the whites they obtained 
Aiints and steels, arid leaned how to use thom.” It is.clear from Qock- 
ing’s ngrrative that the Blackfeet had something much more effective 
than resticks in 1772, and that they did not have to thank white 
men for a Knowledge of the principle of the flint and steel, 
Aguin, Grinnell says: “Tt -is doubtful if the Blackfeet ever 
made any pottery or basket’ware.” Cocking distinetly says that they 
did make earthern pots; and Hendry was served with boiled buffalo meat 
in wicker baskets. Again, Grinnell says that the Blackfeet obtained 
horses in the earliest years of the nineteenth century. Hendry describes 
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
ais * “ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA 
  
them as accomplished horsemen half a century before, and from his 
account it is clear that the Blackfeet had possessed horses for many 
years previously. Probably the earliest years of the eighteenth century 
would be nearer the ‘mark, se the dite when the-Blackfeet first, made 
nse of the horse. 
After taking leave of the hospitable Blackfeet, Hendry travelled 
in a leisurely fashion, first to the westward, crossing Knee Hills Creek’; 
then north-west to a point near the present line of the Calgary abd 
Edmonton railway, about 51° 50’ N. This was his farthest point, to the 
westward. ‘Turning east, he crossed Three Hills Creek; turned north- 
east and crossed Derils Pine Creek; returned to and re-crossed Three 
Hills Creek; then north-east again to e long, narrow lake which he ealls 
* —Archithinue Lake, and which appears to have been present Devils Pino 
Lake... It was-now-the end-of February, 1758, aida few days later 
‘Hendry, having travelled north-east from Devils- Pine Lake, reached tho 
Red Deer once more, many miles above the point where he had crossed 
five months before. He journeyed down-stream on the ice for a few 
miles, and then he and his Indians set to work to build canoes and gather 
provisions for the long trip back to Hudson Bay. April 23rd, the 
river began to break up, and five days later Hendry embarked and pad- 
dled rapidly down-stream. He-followed the Red Deer to its junction 
with the South Saskatchewan, and the latter to the Forks. ~ Below the 
Forks he visited a French trading post, an outpost of the main estab- 
lishment at the mouth of the Pasquia. At the latter he was.entertairied 
by the officer in charge of the district, who had been absent on his out 
| ward journey, This officer was no doubt La Corne. From Fort Poskoyaz 
\. Hendry seems to have followed substantially thé same route as on his 
outward trip, and reached York Fort'on June 20th, 1755, after an 
absence of almost twelve months. 
«In the couise of this eventful and very important journey, Hendry 
explored an immense extent of new country. It is a debatable point 
whether he was:the actual discoverer of the South Saskatchewan and 
North Saskatchewan, ~ Certainly his is the only deseription we have of 
any portion of either branch, up to the year 1754. As already men- 
tioned, a party of Saint-Pierre’s men are said to have ascended one of 
the branches to its upper waters, dnd built Fort La Jonquiére there, in 
Arai; that is, thre. years before Hendry’s journey, Here is Saint- 
BYerre’s own account of the matter, in his Jourmal:—* The order which 
I gave to the Clievalier de Niverville, to establish a post three hundred 
Teagues above that of Paskoya, was exeonted on the 20th May, 1761. 
‘He sent off ten men in tiro canoes, who ascended the river Paskeya a2 
far as the Rocky Mountains, where they’ made @ good fort,, which J 
 
[ovures] YORK FACTORY TO THE BLACKFEET COUNTRY ai9 - 
named Fort Lejonquidre, and a considerable store of provisions, in ex- 
pectation of the arrival of M. de Niverville, who was to set out a month 
after them, but was’ prevented by a serious illness.” Tt would appear 
that de Niverville eventually reached Fort Lajonquiére, as, toward the 
close of Saint-Pierre’s journal it is said: “ML. de Niverville... gave 
me an account of what he hed learned at the settlement he had made 
near the Rocky Mountains.” 
In face of these circumstantial statements it does not seem possible 
to deny the fact that one of the branches of the Saskatchewan was as- 
cended for some distance in 1751, and that Fort La Jonguiére was built 
there. ‘The questions-in doubt are: which branch was ascended; and 
where was Fott La Jonquitre built? As to the former, the evidence is 
somewhat conflicting. On the one hand, it has been objected that Saint- 
Pierre's nien could not have gone up the South Branch as that would 
have brought them into the county ofthe Blacfer, by whom they ip- 
evitably would have been murdered. This opinion is based upon later 
experiences with the Blackfeet, but as has been seen, the Blackfeet 
were exceedingly friendly to white men at the time of Hendry’s visit, 
and if this was the case in 1754, it is altogether likely to have been the 
case in 1751. ‘This argument, therefore, falls to the ground. - On the 
other hand we have the direct statement that the'ruins of Fort La Jon- 
quidre wete found by Captain E. Brisebois, of the North West Mounted 
Police, at the place where the town of Calgary now stands. “Bn 1875,” 
says Judge Prad’homme, in his paper already alluded to (I, 72), “Ia, 
capitaine E. Brisebois, de la police 4 cheval, fut chargé de batir un fort 
au pied des Montagnes Rocheuses. Il Vérigea sur les bords de la riviére 
des Ares, & Pendroit méme quoccupait jadis le fort La Jonquiére, dont 
iT retrouva les ruines et lui donna le-nom de ‘ Fort Brisebois,’ anquel 
a sucesdé depuis celui de Calgary.” Judge Prudhomme presumebly 
obtained this information from Brisebois himself. In any case, M. 
Benjamin Sulte says that some years ago Captain Brisebois told’ him 
positively that he had discovered the ruins of an old fort, at the place 
‘mentioned, which he believed to be those of Fort La Jonquiére. A. good 
deal of weight naturally attaches to this direct statement. Yet it can 
scarcely De regarded as conclusive, Unless Captain Brisebois found 
among the ruins something that positively identified the buildinig as a 
French fort—and of this there is no evidence—otie would be rather in- 
clined to think it the remains of an old North West Company fort 
Remembering the temporary nature of the building erected by Saint- 
Pierre's men, it is highly improbable that any vestige of it would rem 
‘One hundred and twenty-four years afterward. Again, it is to say the 
least singular that, if a 'party of French explorers did actually ascend

the South Saskatchewan in 1751, Hendry should hafe heard nothing 
of it when he visited the Blackfeet three years later, and passed, as far 
as one can judge, within fifty miléé of the place where Fort La Jonquiére 
is said: to have been built, just three years before. On the whole, while 
it seems certain that Fort La Jonquiére was actually built, at some point 
‘on the upper waters of the Saskatchewan, there is no very convincing 
proof available in favour of either branch, Until some reasonably ¢on- 
clusive evidence i8 produced, one may be permitted to Keep an opea 
mind, and lt he advocates of either branch Hight it out among them- 
J selves. . 
One word in conclusion as to Hendry’s earlier history. All that 
wwe know is contained in a couple of notes, by Andrew Graham, appended 
to the narrative, “This Anthony Hendey,” he says, “was born in the 
Island of Wight, and-vas in the year 1748 outlawed for smuggling, and 
in 1750, entertl into the-Company’s Service, the Directors not knowing 
that he was under sentence of outlewry. This person, whom I knew 
well, was Bold, enterprising, and’ voluntarily offered his service to go 
inland with the nativet and explore the country, and to endeavour to 
Gray down the different tribes to the Factory. Before this time none 
of the sorvants dt the Factories had ventured to winter with the natives. 
‘The accounts of horsemen being inland were not eredited. He, Hendey, 
‘was misrepresented by those in the Bay who were not acting a just part 
to the Company,.and he pereciving not likely to meet with promotion 
he had so deservedly merited, quitted the Company's service. Which 
made one of the directors observe afterwards, “That a valuable servant 
oftentimes was not known until lost.’ In another note. Steyn 
     
  
T knew thie man; he,was a bold and good servant and wa&\drovg from 
the Company's service by the ships gentry because he would“Hot buy 
slops and brandy from them. He was the first person who ventured 
inland. I was’ then writer at York Fort.”

the narratives of early travellers throughout the\ vast prairie country 
of North America all bear testimony to the Incalculable numbers of| the 
buffalo, Henry the Blder (‘Travels and Adventures inh Canada,” gt, ed 
by James Bain, p, 286) aay, “thelr numbers were so erent that we dreaded 
lest they’ fairly ‘trample down the camp." Henry the Younger (1, 167) 
ives an even more graphic plcture, "I was awakened," he says,."by the 
bellowing of buffaloes....., the plains were black, and appeared as if in 
motion...... I had seen almost incredible numbers of Viiftaip in the fall, but 
nothing tn comparison to what I now beheld. The ground was covered at 
every point of the compass, aa far as the eye could reach, and every animal 
was in motion.". The accounts of Catlin, Professor Hind, Harmon, Butter, 
ind other writers, are to the same effect. See particularly Vol: I of Cattin's 
N. A. Indians," pp. 247 to end of volume. ‘The late Dr. Selwyn. travelled 
over a portion of the same country explored by Hendry,"in 1878, Not many 
years ago,” he says, “the region we traversed was swarining with biffaloes: 
now, thelr skulls whitening on’the plain, and the deep-worn and grass-grown 
tracks whieh traverse the prairies in all directions, are the only evidence of 
their former existence.” (Geol, Survey 1872-4, p. 61). Mr. W. , Hornaday 
has gone very fully into the whole history of this remarkable afimat in his 
extermination of the Buffalo”j. and Ernest Thompson Seton adds some 
further detalls in sn article on “The American Bison,” (Scribner's 3 on
