# Preface

The edited journal,
its footnotes,
and the editor's notes
were read to the Royal Society of Canada
on May 15, 1907,
and archived online by
[Peel](http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/35.html).

To produce this text,
I ran Peel images through OCRmyPDF
and post-processed the result by hand.
