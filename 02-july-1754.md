## July 1754

July 1. Monday. Took my departure from Musketo-point, and paddled seventeen miles N.W. A heavy rain towards noon with thunder and lightning. The lands high, rocky with shrubby woods. Very shallow water with stones, which obliged us to carry our canoes and goods in several places[^july-1754-1].

[^july-1754-1]: At or near present Mossy Portage. Sir John Franklin mentions this portage in the narrative of his first overland expedition, 1819-22, and says that the canoes were carried through a deep bog for a quarter of a mile. "The river swells out," he says, "above this portage, to the breadth of several miles, and as the islands are numerous there are a great variety of channels." Every traveller who has gone over Hayes route speaks feelingly of the difficulties of navigation below Swampy lake. Mossy portage is but one of many on this portion of the river. Cocking's Journal at this point is nothing much more than a dull repetition of the phrase, "paddled, dragged, and carried the canoes and goods most part of this day."

July 2. Tuesday. Took my departure from Stony-Banks, and paddled 23 miles NW. The river narrow and full of large stones. The banks are rocky and very little woods. The land looks very barren. We have neither seen fish nor fowl yet, so we are scarce of provisions.

July 3. Wednesday. Took my departure from Tickomeg-Reach, and paddled up a branch of Steel River 12 miles N.W.; passed much shoal water with rocky ground; obliged to carry our canoes over it. Passed thirty islands; on one of them grows a few birch trees. The banks of the River are low, on which, grows Small Pines. Saw several Craw-fish and killed a duck.

July 4. Thursday. Left Craw-fish Fall and paddled 22 miles West.[^july-1754-2] Falls and Islands much the same as yesterday. Indians killed three Beaver; here are plenty of their houses.

[^july-1754-2]: Hendry was now passing through Swampy lake. At the entrance to the lake there was, in Franklin's day, a point bearing the significant name of the Dramstone. "We complied," he says dryly, "with the custom from which it derives its name." Here the boats' crews were accustomed to celebrate the "termination of the laborious ascent of Hill River." David Thompson, the famous astronomer of the North West Company, in a description of the Hayes route, says of the portion of the  river below Swampy lake: "This distance is but a succession of banks of sand, impetuous current, broken rocks cropping up to water level; it requires twelve portages, independently of partial discharges and disembarkments at several places." Dr. Robert Bell, in his Report on the country between Lake Winnipeg and Hudson Bay, 1878, says that Swampy lake is a narrow strip of water ten miles long; that its name is derived from a point composed of peat on the northwest side, about half-way down. He adds that for nineteen miles below Swampy lake the river flows through a labyrinth of small islands.

July 5. Friday. Took my departure from fortunate Fall and paddled 25 miles W.b.So. & W.S.W.; passed much shoal-water and twenty-four islands; there is not a foot of water for a mile. We are greatly fatigued with carrying and hauling the Canoes, and not very well fed, but the Natives are continually Smoking, which I already experience allays hunger.

July 6. Saturday. Took my departure from Pike-reach, and paddled 26 miles W.b.S.; then we left Steel River and entered Attick-Sagohan, or Deer Lake;[^july-1754-3] killed a good many pike and three Ducks, which are very acceptable.

[^july-1754-3]: Hendry's distances rather ft in with the theory that his Attick-Sagohan was present Oxford lake, but the course below cannot be reconciled with his passage through the broad expanse of Knee lake. It seems more reasonable to conclude that this lake, the first mentioned on his Journey, was Knee lake. From Swampy lake, which is nothing more than a comparatively insignificant widening of the river, his courses lay up Jack river. His distances here are exaggerated. Jack river is only about ten miles long, very much broken by rapids in the lower half of to course. Knee lake, according to Dr. Bell, has total length of forty miles. Hendry traversed the lower portion, and then entered the river, which he is now about to describe.

July 7. Sunday. Took my departure from Three-Beacon Island and paddled 12 Miles W.S.W.; then came to the River. The Natives are divided as to the name of this River; however, it cannot with propriety be called Apet-Sepee, or Steel River.[^july-1754-4] We paddled 12 miles up it. The Banks are hills and dales on which grow small pines. The River 12 poles wide; the water very deep in some places, and in other places not six inches water and many Islands. Deer-Lake is large and deep, encompassed with tall woods of Pines and Birch trees.

[^july-1754-4]: This river, he says, cannot with propriety be called Steel river. He has, in fact, now left the main stream, which leads up to Oxford lake, and is ascending a small branch, running from the west into Knee lake. He is about to traverse a route from the Hayes or Steel river across to the Nelson, which there is reason to believe was used for a time by H.B.C. men, and then abandoned for the route through Oxford lake and by way of the Echimamish to Little Playgreen lake. The route followed by Hendry has never been explored by officers of the Geological Survey, but, as mentioned in the introduction, information in regard to it has lately been communicated to Mr. Owen O'Sullivan of the Survey by Rev. Mr. Banel, a Roman Catholic missionary, whose field covers much of the unexplored region between the Nelson and Hayes. A note at the beginning of the Journal - presumably Andrew Graham - says: "This man did not go up the road Mr. Thomison goes." Tomison built Hudson House on the North Saskatchewan, and is known to have accompanied David Thompson from York Factory to Manchester House in July, 1787 by the Oxford Lake and Echimamish route - which strengthens the argument for a different route in Hendry's case.

July 8. Monday. Paddled 26 Miles up the River, W.N.W.; Islands and Rocks all the way. In the evening, left the River, and put up on an Island in Christianaux Lake.[^july-1754-5]

[^july-1754-5]: Cocking's Pimochickomow Lake. In the Cree vocabulary in Lieut. Edward Chappel's "Narrative of a Voyage to Hudson's Bay," Pim-mith-e-hick-oe-mow is dened as, A lake broader than long.

July 9. Tuesday. Took my departure from Egg Island, and paddled 26 miles S.W. & S.W.b.S. in the Lake; passed 22 woody Islands, and put up on one for the night.

July 10. Wednesday. Took my departure from Pike Islands, and Paddled 25 miles W.S.W. until we came to a river on the West side the Lake, where we put up for the night.

July 11. Thursday. Took my departure from Shad Fall and paddled two miles S.W. up the River, when it began to blow with Rain, which obliged us to put up. Here twenty Canoes of Natives passed us on their way to York Fort, with whom I sent a letter to Mr. James Isham,[^july-1754-6] the Chief.

[^july-1754-6]: Then factor at York.

July 12. Friday. A continuance of rain; paddled none. Some drinking and others fishing. Fish is our daily food.

July 13. Saturday. Paddled 28 miles. The River wide with small Islands; Banks low and small woods; our course to-day S.W.

July 14. Sunday. Paddled 25 miles S.W. The River in general good water. Indians caught a good many large Pike.

July 15. Monday. Paddled 24 miles S.W.b.S. met four Canoes of Indians in the French interest the Leader's name Monkonsko. He behaved civilly and informed me that I was on the Confines of the dry inland country, called by the Natives the Muscuty Tuskee; and that I should soon see a French House.

July 16. Tuesday. Paddled 20 miles S.W.b.S. then came to Othenume Lake.[^july-1754-7]

[^july-1754-7]: Cocking's Oteatowan Sockoegan - present Moose Lake, north of Cedar Lake, on the Lower Saskatchewan.

July 17. Wednesday. Paddled 20 miles S.W.b.S.; than came to a River. Othenume Lake is a good day's paddle either way; and the woods around it are tall and well grown timber.

July 18. Thursday. Paddled 26 miles up the river; good water for a Canoe; the river wide, banks high, and no woods to be seen; no provisions to be got but fish.

July 19. Friday. Paddled 26 miles up the river.

July 20. Saturday. Paddled 6 miles S.W.b.S. and after dragging our Canoes 3/4 miles thro' a Swampy drain intermixed with Willows, came to Nelson River and paddled on until we came to a small branch. The River is 16 poles wide, water deep and current runs Eastward, and low banks with poplars and willows.

July 21. Sunday. Paddled two miles up the River, and then came to Keiskatchewan[^july-1754-8] River, on which the French have two houses, one of which we expect to see to-morrow; paddled up it 8 miles West; passed a large lake, which helps to supply the River.

[^july-1754-8]: For various spellings, and origin of the name, see Dr. Coues' foot-note, pp. 461-2, Henry-Thompson Journals.

July 22. Monday. The Musketoes are now intolerable, giving us neither peace day nor night; paddled 14 miles up the River West, when we came to a French house.[^july-1754-9] On our arrival two Frenchmen came to the water-side, and in a very genteel manner, invited me into their house, which I readily accepted. One of them asked me if I had any Letter from my Master, and where, and on what design I was going inland. I answered I had no letter, and that I was sent to view the Country, and intended to return in the Spring. He told me the Master and men were gone down to Montreal with the furs; and that they must detain me till their return. However they were very kind; and at night I went to my tent, and told Attickashish, or Little Deer, my Leader,[^july-1754-10] that had the charge of me, who smiled and said they dared not. I sent them two feet of tobacco, which was very acceptable to them.

[^july-1754-9]: "Basquea," as he calls it when he visits the place on his return journey - Fort Poskoyac, bullt by the younger La Vérendrye about the year 1748; visited by Boucher de Niverville in his exploration of the Saskatchewan in 1851; and occupied by Saint-Luc de La Corne at the time of Hendry's journey. Cocking says in his journal, under date July 31, 1772, "Proceeded & came to Basquia. Here at a small river where the Natives killed Guiniads with hand nets. Many Natives had been here lately. This is a long frequented place where the Canadians rendezvous & trade with the Natives. Many of their Superstitious & Fanciful marks are seen here." And in a foot-note - "From York Fort to Basquia I make the Course South 46 West, distance 450 miles." Cocking mentions "an old house formerly belonging to the Canadians," i.e. the French.

[^july-1754-10]: "Attickashish," says Andrew Graham, "was afterwards my Acquaintance and a valuable leading Indian."

July 23. Tuesday. Invited to Breakfast and Dinner; thanked me for the tobacco, and presented to me some moose flesh.

July 24. Wednesday. Took my departure from the French Settlement, and paddled up Keiskatchewan River 6 miles; the Course West. Then left it and padded 16 miles W.b.S. across a Lake;[^july-1754-11] then came to Peatago River;[^july-1754-12] here are the largest Birch trees I have yet seen.

[^july-1754-11]: Saskeram Lake. Cocking calls this lake, Maneneshahsquatanan Sakahegan.

[^july-1754-12]: Carrot River. Pe-tahk-ho-gun, according to Chappell, means, A long distance by water. Cocking also mentions a Peatagow River, but farther up the Saskatchewan.

July 25. Thursday. Paddled up Peatago River 27 miles S.W.b.W. Large Birch trees on both sides the River. We still live on fish and are all heartily wishing for a change of food. This river is small, but good water as yet. To-morrow we shall leave our canoes and travel.

July 26. Friday. Paddled 28 Miles S.W.b.W. up Peatago River, shoal water; passed 9 Islands, 4 Falls, and several Canoes, which the natives had left on account of shoal water.

July 27. Saturday. Very shoal water. Here we left our Canoes and travelled 4 miles S.W.b.S. Here were our Indians Families in a starving condition for want of food; and we are in the same condition.

July 28. Sunday. Travelled 26 miles S.W.b.W. passed two creeks and two Indian tent-places. Neither Bird nor Beast to be seen, so that we have nothing to eat.

July 29. Monday. Travelled 24 miles S.W. when fortunately met with a fine bed of Strawberries, of which I did not eat[^july-1754-13] very heartily, as did the Natives. Two miles farther, we met with berries the size of black currants and the finest I ever eat. I, as also the Natives, are fatigued with our two days' journies, which we are obliged to perform to come up to where provisions are to be had.

[^july-1754-13]: Obviously "not" is an error in the original or copy.

July 30. Tuesday. Travelled 16 miles S.W. level land, cherry trees, and fields of tares are full and ripe as any in England. Indians killed two Moose.

July 31. Wednesday. Travelled 13 Miles W.S.W. Level lands and burnt woods; and there are nothing but stagnated water to drink. Came to two tents of Asinepoet Indians.[^july-1754-14] I smoaked with them, and talked with them to go down with me to York Fort in the summer, but they answered, "We are conveniently supplied from the Pagua-Mistagushewuck Whiskeheginish." That is, the Frenchman's House of Trade.[^july-1754-15]

[^july-1754-14]: Umfreville, in his "Present State of Hudson's Bay," 1790, calls them the Assinepoetuc or Stone Indians: In Dobb's "Account of the Countries adjoining to Hudson's Bay," 1744, they are named Assinibouels. Sir John Richardson gives the Cree name as Asseeneepoytuck, or Stone Indians. There are many other variants of the name in early narratives and journals. The tribe was finally known as the Assiniboines. According to Franklin the Assiniboines called themselves E?s???, Originally they formed part of the Sioux family, but separated as a result of some tribal quarrel and wandered north through the Red River country to the great plains south of the Saskatchewan. Alexander Henry, the Younger, gives an interesting account of the tribe in his Journal (pp. 516 et seq.); and reference may be made to the "Travels and Adventures" of the older Henry, as well as to Dr. James Bain's foot-note on p. 277. See also John McDonnell's Narrative 1793-87, in Masson's "Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nord-Ouest," I, 278-9.

[^july-1754-15]: Hendry elsewhere bears unwilling testimony to the remarkable hold obtained by the French traders upon the western Indians.
