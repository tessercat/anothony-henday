## August 1754

August 1. Thursday. Travelled 12 miles S.W.b.S., fine level land and tall woods; passed three small creeks of sweet water. The Indians killed two moose; I am now entering a pleasant and plentiful country.

August 2. Friday. Travelled 10 miles S.W.b.S. Hills and Dales with little woods. Indians killed 6 Waskesew.

August 3. Saturday. Travelled 10 miles S.W.b.S. Level land with cherry trees, on which are plenty of fruit, plenty of Filberts. Indians killed 2 moose.

August 4. Sunday. Travelled 10 miles N.W. Land and Woods as yesterday. Met with 7 tents of Asinepoet Indians. I smoaked with them - but have no hopes of getting them to the Fort - as what cloth &c. they had were French, and, by their behaviour, I perceived they were strongly attached to the French interest. Indians killed 2 Moose.

August 5. Monday. Travelled 11 miles W.S.W. Level land and poor Woods; Killed four Waskesew, or Red Deer, a stately animal, but the flesh coarse, and no manner equal to Moose flesh; however all is welcome to us.

August 6. Tuesday. Travelled 11 miles W.S.W. Level lands, and tall ledges of woods; crossed several small creeks of good water, which is acceptable; not having seen any these three days past.

August 7. Wednesday. Travelled none. Indians killed 3 Waskesew and 2 Moose.

August 8. Thursday. Travelled none. All hands feasting, smoking, drinking, dancing and conjuring.[^august-1754-1].

[^august-1754-1]: Nearly all early travelers through Western America have had something to say of the "Medicine" practices of the various tribes. Particularly full and valuable accounts are given in Catlin's "North American Indians," and Maximilian of Wied's Travels, as well as in the Reports of the Bureau of Ethonology, Washington.

August 9. Friday. Level land; poplars and Willows. Passed two Salt Lakes, large lumps of Salt candid (sic) laying round the edges.[^august-1754-2] Indians killed 2 Moose.

[^august-1754-2]: Hendry has now travelled about 225 miles trom the French post at the mouth of the Pasquia, and is perhaps 70 miles east of Clark Crossing on the South Saskatchewan. Salt, or rather alkaline, lakes and ponds abound in this part of the country. Cocking describes similar lakes: "We pitched on the side of a lake, the water disagreeable, bitterish, salt taste; salt laying on the surface an inch thick (a specimen of which I have preserved) and the shore like rime in a frosty morning." Dr. Robert Bell says (Geol. Survey Report, 1878-79, p. 10 c.), "I collected specimens of the white efflorescing salt or 'alkali' which every traveller observes around many of the lakes and covering the dry beds of ponds in the region drained by the western branch of the Assiniboine, and found that it consists principally of sulphate of sodium and magnesium, together with chlorides of calcium and sodium."

August 10. Saturday. Travelled 4 miles W.b.N.; then put up to feast &c.

August 11. Sunday. Travelled 11 Miles S.W.b.W. Level lands, short grass; no woods; and no water but what is salt.

August 12. Monday. Travelled 7 Miles W.S.W. Level land, with small black Cherry trees, yielding plenty of fruit. Nothing but salt lakes.

August 13. Tuesday. Travelled 7 Miles W.S.W. Level land, short Grass, Dry-woods, and several salt water lakes. We are now entering Muscuty plains, and shall soon see plenty of Buffalo, and the Archithinue Indians[^august-1754-3] hunting them on Horse-back.

[^august-1754-3]: Blackfeet, See Introduction.

August 14. Wednesday. Travelled none. The young Men hunting, killed several Moose and Waskesew; provisions plenty and good food.

August 15. Thursday. Travelled 8 Miles West; saw several herds of Buffalo.

August 16. Friday. Travelled 15 Miles W.b.N. Level land, with Birch, Cherry and Nut-trees; passed a Lake of Salt water; saw two Buffalo and two Horses; killed 6 Waskesew.

August 17. Saturday. Travelled 8 Miles W.N.W. Crossed a large hill full of Shrubs, and fine berries like unto black currants. Started a Hare, of size and color like those in England. Indians killed 4 Waskesew.

August 18. Sunday. Travelled none. The Young Men hunting, killed several Moose. I dressed a lame man's leg. He gave me a Moose nose, which is a delicate dish, for my trouble. At this place, a mineral spring as cold as ice.

August 19. Monday. Travelled 10 Miles W.S.W. in Muscuty plains; fine land, no woods; several salt-water Lakes; have passed but 4 places of fresh water, these five days past.

August 20. Tuesday. Travelled 15 Miles North; then came to Wapesekcopet River.[^august-1754-4] It is large; the banks are high; on which grow Birch, Poplar, Hazle, Elder, Fir, etc.; killed 5 Waskesew.

[^august-1754-4]: South Saskatchewan. Hendry crossed some distance above present town of Saskatoon, at or near Clark Crossing. Descriptive notes on Fleming's 1858 map agree with Hendry's narrative - "precipitous clay bluffs 100 feet high. Groves of poplar and birch."

August 21. Wednesday. The Indian Men made temporary Canoes of Willows, covered with parchment Moose skins.[^august-1754-5] The Women gathered plenty of excellent berries, and cherries. I angled a few small Trout; and in the evening we crossed the River in our Slender Canoes, without any accident happening.

[^august-1754-5]: Cocking made use of similar device. Aug. 23rd, 1872, he crossed the Saskatchewan in "temporary Canoes with bended sticks, & covered with parchment skins." John Fleming notes the presence of the same novel craft on the Saskatchewan as late as 1858, and attributes thelr use to the scarcity of birchbark for canoes in the region through which the north and south branches flow. "These great prairie-rivers," he says, (Narrative of Canadian Red River Expedition, etc., I, 442), "are generally crossed and often descended in 'bull-boats' or 'parchment canoes,' by the Indians, for great distances. These bull-boats are made of one or two buffalo skins, stretched on a light frame, stitched together, and the seams covered with tallow and ashes. Hunters and trappers frequently set out from Fort a la Corne, on horseback or on foot, to the Moose Woods or the great prairies on the South Saskatchewan, and return in bull-boats laden with dried meat and skins, both craft and cargo being the proceeds of their hunt." Catlin found the same boats in use among the Minatarees on the Upper Missouri. He describes it ("North American Indians," I, 195) as "a skin-canoe (more familiarly called in this country a bull-boat) made in the form of a large tub, of a buffalo skin, stretched on a frame of willow boughs." Catlin and two companions entered one of them and an athletic squaw swam across the river, drawing the boat with one hand. The traveller gives an amusing description of how he was held up in mid-stream by a party of Minataree girls who swam out from the opposite shore, and swung the boat round and round until Catlin was thankful to pay tribute in strings of beads.

August 22. Thursday. Travelled 12 Miles N.W. Level land and dry ridges of woods; saw no water till we put up at night; and that was fresh and good, thank God. Indians killed 6 Waskesew. They are plenty and although coarse food, yet go well down with me and my companions.

August 23. Friday. Travelled 12 miles West. Level land, no Woods, nor water, till the evening; came to a ledge of Poplars and sweet water. The Archithinue Natives has been here lately; we know by their horses dung and foot-steps.

August 24. Saturday. Travelled 12 Miles W.b.N. Attickasish, my Leader, and two young men, went another way in quest of the Archithinue Natives. In the evening came to Sechonby River;[^august-1754-6] it is about two furlongs wide, & full of sandy Islands; the current runs easterly, and very rapid; the water deep; the banks high, on which grow Birch & Hazle trees.

[^august-1754-6]: North Saskatchewan, at or about the Elbow (107Â° W.). Hendry's description will readily be recognized by anyone familiar with the locality.

August 25. Sunday. Travelled 2 miles West up the River in the Archithinue track. Level land, no woods but what grow on the bank; plenty of berries.

August 26. Monday. Travelled 14 Miles W.b.N. the land level; no woods; but plenty of fine grass. Saw two Buffalo feeding on the other side of the river. Met an aged man and a horse loaded with moose flesh, which he parted amongst us.

August 27. Tuesday. Travelled W.b.N. 16 Miles. Passed several ponds, & one creek of running water, in which we caught 17 small Trout. In the evening came to 24 tents of Asinepoet Indians. They have plenty of moose & Beaver flesh, with which they treated us liberally.

August 28. Wednesday. Travelled none. Young men hunting, killed 2 Moose; Myself and Brother Leaders feasting &c. with the Asinepoet Natives.

August 29. Thursday. All hands feasting, dancing, drumming, &c.

August 30. Friday. Left the Asinepoet Indians, and travelled N.W. 10 Miles. Level Barren land, not one stick of wood to be seen, & no water to drink.

August 31. Saturday. Travelled 12 Miles N.W. The Indians killed 4 Waskesew, and I killed one. We are yet in Muscuty plains; plenty of good water to-day.
