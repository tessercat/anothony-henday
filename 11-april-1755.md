[^april-1755-2]: Catlin, after describing a dog-feast at one of the Sioux villages on the Upper Missouri, says (N. A. Indians, I, 230-1, and Plate 96), "I have been honoured with numerous entertainments of the kind amongst the other tribes which I have visited towards the sources of the Missouri, and all conducted in the same solemn and impressive manner; from which I feel authorized to pronounced the dog-feast a truly religious ceremony, wherein the poor Indian sees fit to sacrifice his faithful companion to bear testimony to the sacredness of his vows of friendship...... The dog-feast is given, I believe, by all tribes in North America; and by them all, I think, this faithful animal, as well as the horse, is sacrificed in several different ways, to appease offended Spirits or Deities." Alexander Henry, the Elder, gives instances of doos being sacrifices to avert some threatened misfortune.
